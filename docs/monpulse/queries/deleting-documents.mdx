# Deleting Documents

We can delete a single document using `deleteOne` method and multiple documents using `delete` method.

## Delete one document

To delete a single document, use the `deleteOne` method:

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { query } from "@mongez/monpulse";

const result = await query.deleteOne("users", {
  _id: "60b9b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0b0",
});
```

## Delete multiple documents

To delete multiple documents, use the `delete` method:

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { query } from "@mongez/monpulse";

const result = await query.delete("users");
```

This will delete the entire collection documents, but will not delete the collection itself.

To delete certain documents, pass the filter object as the second argument:

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { query } from "@mongez/monpulse";

const result = await query.delete("users", {
  age: {
    $gt: 18,
  },
});
```

It will delete all users with age greater than 18.
