# Introduction

Queries over MongoDB has many types, but in this section we will work with the most common ones.

## Query Manager

This is basically the underlying class for other higher levels such as Models and Aggregate framework, so let's see how this work in a nutshell.

## Basic Usage

By default Monpulse is shipped with an instance of the query manager, you can import it directly from the package.

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { query } from "@mongez/monpulse";

const users = await query.list("users");
```

This will return all users in the database, but you can pass a query object to filter the results.

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { query } from "@mongez/monpulse";

const users = await query.list("users", {
    name: "John",
});
```

In that sense we can conclude that any query you want to use receives the first argument as the collection name, and rest of arguments depends on the method arguments itself.

In the next sections, we will see each operation of the `CRUD` operations in details.
