# Lookup (Joins)

Perform lookups (joins) on your collections.

Before we get started, please review the [Lookup Pipeline](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#lookup-pipeline) documentation.

## Method Signature

```ts
public lookup(options: LookupPipelineOptions): this;
```

Where `LookupOptions` is:

```ts
export type LookupPipelineOptions = {
  from: string;
  localField?: string;
  foreignField?: string;
  as?: string;
  single?: boolean;
  pipeline?: (Pipeline | GenericObject)[];
  let?: GenericObject;
};
```

## Example

Let's see a basic example, let's see we need to load posts with the updated data of the authors from users collection.

```ts
const posts = await new Aggregate("posts")
  .lookup({
    from: "users",
    localField: "author.id",
    foreignField: "id",
    as: "author",
    single: true,
  })
  .get();
```

By adding `single` option, it will return the first document in the array.

## Lookup with multiple documents

Let's load posts with their comments.

```ts
const posts = await new Aggregate("posts")
  .lookup({
    from: "comments",
    localField: "id",
    foreignField: "postId",
    as: "comments",
  })
  .get();
```

This will load with each post all the comments that belong to it.

## Lookup with pipeline

Let's load posts with their comments, but we want to load only the comments that have more than 10 likes.

```ts
const posts = await new Aggregate("posts")
  .lookup({
    from: "comments",
    localField: "id",
    foreignField: "postId",
    as: "comments",
    pipeline: [
      {
        $match: {
          likes: {
            $gt: 10,
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  })
  .get();
```

## Calling MongoDB Aggregate stages

Most of MongoDB Aggregate stages are exported separately, so we can use them directly in the pipelines.

Let's load posts with their comments, but we want to load only the comments that have more than 10 likes.

```ts
import { wherePipeline, parsePipelines } from "@mongez/monpulse";

const posts = await new Aggregate("posts")
  .lookup({
    from: "comments",
    localField: "id",
    foreignField: "postId",
    as: "comments",
    pipeline: parsePipelines([wherePipeline("likes", ">", 10)]),
  })
  .get();
```

### Available stages to use

Here are the available stages to use with `parsePipelines` function:

- `wherePipeline`: Receives same arguments as `where` method.
- `limitPipeline`: Receives same arguments as `limit` method.
- `skipPipeline`: Receives same arguments as `skip` method.
- `sortPipeline`: Receives same arguments as `sort` method.
- `sortByPipeline`: Receives same arguments as `sortBy` method.
- `sortRandomPipeline`: Receives same arguments as `random` method.
- `selectPipeline`: Receives same arguments as `select` method.
- `deselectPipeline`: Receives same arguments as `deselect` method.
- `groupByPipeline`: Receives same arguments as `groupBy` method.
- `lookupPipeline`: Receives same arguments as `lookup` method.
- `orWherePipeline`: Receives same arguments as `orWhere` method.
- `unwindPipeline`: Receives same arguments as `unwind` method.

## Lookup with let

Let's load posts with their comments, but we want to load only the comments that have more than 10 likes.

```ts
const posts = await new Aggregate("posts")
  .lookup({
    from: "comments",
    localField: "id",
    foreignField: "postId",
    as: "comments",
    let: {
      postId: "$id",
    },
    pipeline: [
      {
        $match: {
          $expr: {
            $and: [
              {
                $eq: ["$postId", "$$postId"],
              },
              {
                $gt: ["$likes", 10],
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  })
  .get();
```

> This is just the native MongoDB syntax, you can use it directly in the `pipeline` option.
