# Destroying Models

There are two ways to destroy a model, one when we have an instance of the model and the other when we don't.

## Delete documents

If we don't care of having an instance of the model, we can use the `delete` method to delete documents from the database.

```ts
await User.delete({ name: "John" });
```

This will delete all the documents that match the query and return the number of documents deleted.

If we want to delete a document using `id` or `_id`, simply pass the value directly to the `delete` method.

```ts
await User.delete(1);
```

> Please note that `_id` must be a string or an instance of `ObjectId` class.

## Destroy model

If we already have an instance of the model we can use `destroy` method.

```ts
import { User } from "./models/User";

const user = await User.find(1);

await user.destroy();
```

This will delete the document from the database but you still can work with the instance of the model.

:::tip
If you tried to save the model after destroying it, it will throw an error.
:::

## Recycle bin

When using the `destroy` model, by default the model is actually deleted but before that a copy of the model document is taken and moved to the trash collection. This is done to prevent accidental deletion of documents.

The trash collection name is the model's collection name suffixed with `Trash`. For example, if the model's collection name is `users`, the trash collection name will be `usersTrash`.

## Restoring documents

If documents are deleted using Recycle bin `destroy` method, you can restore them using the `restore` method.

```ts
await User.restore(1);
```

This will restore the document with the given id and return the restored document.

## Restoring multiple documents

If you want to restore all the documents in the trash collection, you can use the `restoreAll` method.

```ts
const restoredUsers = await User.restoreAll();
```

If you want to restore specific documents, you can pass a query to the `restoreAll` method.

```ts
const restoredUsers = await User.restoreAll({ name: "John" });
```

## Model Delete Strategies

We saw earlier the `moveToTrash` strategy which is the default strategy. There are two other strategies that you can use.

You can override the model's default delete strategy by setting the `deleteStrategy` property on the model.

```ts
import { Model, ModelDeleteStrategy } from "@mongez/monpulse";

export class User extends Model {
  /**
   * The collection name
   */
  public static collection = "users";

  /**
   * The delete strategy
   * Delete the documents forever.
   */
  public static deleteStrategy = ModelDeleteStrategy.hardDelete;
}
```

### hardDelete strategy

This strategy will delete the document without moving it to the trash collection, so it's gone forever.

```ts
import { Model, ModelDeleteStrategy } from "@mongez/monpulse";

export class User extends Model {
  /**
   * The collection name
   */
  public static collection = "users";

  /**
   * The delete strategy
   * Delete the documents forever.
   */
  public static deleteStrategy = ModelDeleteStrategy.hardDelete;
}
```

Now whenever you call the `destroy` method, the document will be deleted forever.

```ts
await User.find(1).destroy();
```

### softDelete strategy

This strategy will add a `deletedAt` field to the document and set it to the current date and time. This field will be used to determine if the document is deleted or not.

```ts
import { Model, ModelDeleteStrategy } from "@mongez/monpulse";

export class User extends Model {
  /**
   * The collection name
   */
  public static collection = "users";

  /**
   * The delete strategy
   * Delete the documents forever.
   */
  public static deleteStrategy = ModelDeleteStrategy.softDelete;
}
```

Now whenever you call the `destroy` method, the document will be soft deleted.

:::tip
You can use the `restore` and `restoreAll` methods to restore the documents, this will remove the `deletedAt` field from the documents.
:::

Now whenever you use any [listing method](./fetching-documents) the soft deleted documents will be excluded from the results.

:::info
If you want to include the deleted documents in your results, pass `withDeleted` option to the listing filters with `true` value.
:::

```ts
// fetch all users including the deleted ones
await User.list({ withDeleted: true });

// fetch all users excluding the deleted ones
await User.list();
```
