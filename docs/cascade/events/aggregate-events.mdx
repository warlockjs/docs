## Introduction

Aggregate events are triggered when performing aggregate operations.

## Types of Events

There are three types of events in the Aggregate:

1. `fetching`: This event is triggered when calling `get`, `first`, `latest`, `oldest` or `count` methods.
2. `updating`: This event is triggered when calling `update` method.
3. `deleting`: This event is triggered when calling `delete` method.

## Accessing Aggregate Events

To access the Aggregate events manager, call the `events()` method on the Aggregate class `(not the instance)`.

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

Aggregate.events()
  .onFetching((aggregate) => {
    // do something
  })
  .onUpdating((aggregate) => {
    // do something
  })
  .onDeleting((aggregate) => {
    // do something
  });
```
