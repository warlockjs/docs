## Introduction

The query builder serves as the most internal layer for other operations such as **Models** and **Aggregate**. Let's explore the events associated with the query builder.

## On Creating Event

This event is triggered before creating a new document or documents.

Method Signature:

```ts
public onCreating(callback: (payload: CreatingEventPayload) => void): this;
```

```ts src=app.ts
import { query } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

function main() {
  query.onCreating(({ collection, query, data, isMany }) => {
    // do something
  });

  // will trigger the `onCreating` event when creating a new document
  query.create("users", { name: "John Doe" });

  // will trigger the `onCreating` event when creating many documents
  query.createMany("users", [{ name: "John Doe" }, { name: "Jane Doe" }]);
}

main();
```

The payload contains the following properties:

- `collection`: The collection name.
- `query`: The [Collection Query](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/Next/classes/Collection.html)
- `data`: The data to be inserted.
- `isMany`: A boolean value that indicates if the operation is for many documents or not.

That event is triggered when calling `create` or `createMany` methods.

## On Created Event

This event is triggered after creating a new document or documents.

Method Signature:

```ts
public onCreated(callback: (payload: CreatedEventPayload) => void): this;
```

```ts src=app.ts
import { query } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

function main() {
  query.onCreated(({ collection, document, documents, data, isMany }) => {
    // do something
  });

  // will trigger the `onCreated` event after creating a new document
  query.create("users", { name: "John Doe" });

  // will trigger the `onCreated` event after creating many documents
  query.createMany("users", [{ name: "John Doe" }, { name: "Jane Doe" }]);
}

main();
```

The payload contains the following properties:

- `collection`: The collection name.
- `document`: The created document, exists when calling `create` method.
- `documents`: The created documents, exists when calling `createMany` method.
- `data`: The data that was inserted.

That event is triggered when calling `create` or `createMany` methods.

This event is triggered before updating a document or documents.

Method Signature:

```ts

function main() {
  query.onUpdating(
    ({ collection, query, data, isMany, filter, updateOptions, options }) => {
      // do something
    }
  );

  // will trigger the `onUpdating` event when updating a document
  const filter = { name: "John Doe" };

  query.update("users", filter, { name: "Jane Doe New Name" });

  // will trigger the `onUpdating` event when updating many documents
  query.updateMany("users", filter, {
    $set: {
      name: "Jane Doe New Name",
    },
  });
}
```

The payload contains the following properties:

- `collection`: The collection name.
- `query`: The [Collection Query](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/Next/classes/Collection.html)

- `filter`: The filter that will be used to update the document or documents based on it.
- `updateOptions`: This is the [Update Filter](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/Next/interfaces/UpdateManyModel.html#update) object which is the second argument of `updateMany` method
- `options`: [Update options](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/Next/interfaces/UpdateOptions.html), will be passed only when calling `updateMany` method.

That event is triggered when calling `update` or `updateMany` methods.
