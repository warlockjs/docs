# Connecting To Database

Connecting to a database is easy. You can use the `connectToDatabase` method to connect to a database. The `connect` method accepts a single argument, which is the name of the database you want to connect to.

## Building Url Connection

If you want to make it simple, you can easily pass the database connection url segments, which contains: `host`, `port`, `username`, `password`, and `dbAuth`.

```ts
import { connectToDatabase } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

connectToDatabase({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 27017,
  database: "my-database",
  username: "my-username",
  password: "my-password",
  dbAuth: "admin",
});
```

These are the minimum configurations needed to connect to MongoDB server, but you can pass more options to the `connectToDatabase` function that receives the same options as the `MongoClient` instance.

```ts {10,11}
import { connectToDatabase } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

connectToDatabase({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 27017,
  database: "my-database",
  username: "my-username",
  password: "my-password",
  dbAuth: "admin",
  retryWrites: true,
  replicaSet: "rs0",
});
```

## Using Connection Url

Alternatively, you can pass the connection url directly to the `connectToDatabase` function.

```ts
import { connectToDatabase } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

connectToDatabase({
  url: "mongodb://localhost:27017/my-database",
  database: "my-database",
});
```

## Singleton Connection

Using `connectToDatabase` will ensure that connection is established only once `Singleton Pattern`, and will ignore any other calls to the `connectToDatabase` function.

:::tip
If you want to use multiple database, you don't need to create multiple connections, you can use the `useDatabase` method to switch between databases.
:::

## Creating more than one connection

In some situations, you might need to create multiple connections per project, in that sense you can manually create a new `Connection` instance.

```ts
import { Connection } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const connection = new Connection();

connection.connect({
  // same configurations as the connectToDatabase function
});
```

## Once connected

Sometimes you want to execute a code when the connection is established, you can use the `onceConnected` method to execute a callback when the connection is established.

```ts
import { onceConnected } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

onceConnected(() => {
  // do something
});
```

If the connection is not established yet, the callback will be added to the queue, and will be executed once the connection is established, otherwise it will be executed immediately.
