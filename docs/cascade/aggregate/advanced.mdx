# Advanced Usage

Aggregate class is also shipped with more useful methods to help you use queries easily.

## Min

To get minimum value of a field, we can use `min` method.

Method Signature:

```ts
public min(field: string): number;
```

Example:

```ts
const minAge = await aggregate.min("age");
```

This will return the minimum age of all users.

## Get Max value

To get maximum value of a field, we can use `max` method.

Method Signature:

```ts
public max(field: string): number;
```

Example:

```ts
const maxAge = await aggregate.max("age");
```

## Get Average value

To get average value of a field, we can use `avg` method.

Method Signature:

```ts
public avg(field: string): number;
```

Example:

```ts
const avgAge = await aggregate.avg("age");
```

> `average` is an alias for `avg` method.

## Get Sum value

To get sum value of a field, we can use `sum` method.

Method Signature:

```ts
public sum(field: string): number;
```

Example:

```ts
const totalSalaries = await aggregate.sum("salary");
```

We can also use filters with it as well by using `where` method:

```ts
const totalSalaries = await aggregate.where("age", ">", 20).sum("salary");
```

## Get distinct values

To get distinct values of a field, we can use `distinct` method.

Method Signature:

```ts
public distinct(field: string): any[];
```

Example:

```ts
const distinctAges = await aggregate.distinct("age");
```

It will return an array of values.

> Please note that if the field has a null value, it will be returned as well.

You can also use `unique` method as an alias to it.

## Get Distinct Heavy Values

This method is similar to `distinct` method, but it will return the distinct values without the `null` values.

Method Signature:

```ts
public distinctHeavy(field: string): any[];
```

Example:

```ts
const distinctAges = await aggregate.distinctHeavy("age");
```

> `uniqueHeavy` is an alias for `distinctHeavy` method.
