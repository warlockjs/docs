# $agg

The `$agg` utility is a helper that helps you build your aggregate query in a more readable way.

This would be used mostly with the group by stage to build the group by fields.

Let's see an example

## Example of usage

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .groupBy("age", {
    total: $agg.count(),
    totalAges: $agg.sum("age"),
    firstName: $agg.first("name"),
    lastName: $agg.last("name"),
  })
  .get();
```

## Available methods

Here are the available methods:

### Count total documents

This method counts the total number of documents in the group.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .groupBy("gender", {
    total: $agg.count(),
  })
  .get();
```

This will return something like this:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "male",
    "total": 10
  },
  {
    "_id": "female",
    "total": 5
  }
]
```

### Sum field

To sum a column's value use `$agg.sum` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .groupBy("gender", {
    score: $agg.sum("score"),
  })
  .get();
```

### Get Field Average

To get the average of a column's value use `$agg.avg` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .groupBy("gender", {
    averageScore: $agg.avg("score"),
  })
  .get();
```

Alternatively, you can use `average` method:

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .groupBy("gender", {
    averageScore: $agg.average("score"),
  })
  .get();
```

### Get Field Minimum Value

To get the minimum value of a column's value use `$agg.min` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .groupBy(null, {
    score: $agg.min("score"),
  })
  .get();
```

### Get Field Maximum Value

To get the maximum value of a column's value use `$agg.max` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .groupBy(null, {
    score: $agg.max("score"),
  })
  .get();
```

### Get Field First Value

As working with group by could be tricky, you may want to get the first value of a column, this is where `$agg.first` method comes in handy.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .groupBy(null, {
    firstName: $agg.first("name"),
  })
  .get();
```

### Get Field Last Value

As working with group by could be tricky, you may want to get the last value of a column, this is where `$agg.last` method comes in handy.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .groupBy(null, {
    lastName: $agg.last("name"),
  })
  .get();
```

> Read more about [last](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/last/)

### Greater than operator

To get the documents where the value of a field is greater than a specific value, use `$agg.gt` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.gt(10),
  })
  .get();
```

Alternatively, you can use `greaterThan` method:

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.greaterThan(10),
  })
  .get();
```

### Greater than or equal operator

To get the documents where the value of a field is greater than or equal a specific value, use `$agg.gte` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.gte(10),
  })
  .get();
```

Alternatively, you can use `greaterThanOrEqual` method:

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.greaterThanOrEqual(10),
  })
  .get();
```

### Less than operator

To get the documents where the value of a field is less than a specific value, use `$agg.lt` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.lt(10),
  })
  .get();
```

Alternatively, you can use `lessThan` method:

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.lessThan(10),
  })
  .get();
```

### Less than or equal operator

To get the documents where the value of a field is less than or equal a specific value, use `$agg.lte` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.lte(10),
  })
  .get();
```

Alternatively, you can use `lessThanOrEqual` method:

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.lessThanOrEqual(10),
  })
  .get();
```

### Equal operator

To get the documents where the value of a field is equal a specific value, use `$agg.eq` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.eq(10),
  })
  .get();
```

Alternatively, you can use `$agg.equal` method:

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.equal(10),
  })
  .get();
```

### Not equal operator

To get the documents where the value of a field is not equal a specific value, use `$agg.ne` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.ne(10),
  })
  .get();
```

Alternatively, you can use `$agg.notEqual` method:

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.notEqual(10),
  })
  .get();
```

### In operator

To get the documents where the value of a field is in a specific array of values, use `$agg.in` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate
  .where({
    score: $agg.in([10, 20, 30]),
  })
  .get();
```

### In Array operator

To get the documents where the value of a field is in a specific array of values, use `$agg.inArray` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  score: $agg.inArray([10, 20, 30]),
});
```

### Not in operator

To get the documents where the value of a field is not in a specific array of values, use `$agg.nin` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  score: $agg.nin([10, 20, 30]),
});
```

Alternatively, you can use `$agg.notIn` method:

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  score: $agg.notIn([10, 20, 30]),
});
```

> Also `$agg.notInArray` method is an alias for `$agg.notIn` method.

### Exists operator

To get the documents where the field exists, use `$agg.exists` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  score: $agg.exists(),
});
```

### Not exists operator

To get the documents where the field does not exist, use `$agg.notExists` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  score: $agg.notExists(),
});
```

### Regex operator

To get the documents where the field matches a specific regular expression, use `$agg.regex` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  name: $agg.regex(/john/i),
});
```

### Like operator

This is just a syntactic sugar for `$agg.regex` method, to feel more comfortable with SQL syntax.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  name: $agg.like(/john/i),
});
```

The `like` operator will also make the search ignore the case of the given value if the given value is a string.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  name: $agg.like("john"),
});
```

### Not like operator

This is just a syntactic sugar for the **negate** of the given value of `$agg.regex` method, to feel more comfortable with SQL syntax.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  name: $agg.notLike(/john/i),
});
```

The `notLike` operator will also make the search ignore the case of the given value if the given value is a string.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  name: $agg.notLike("john"),
});
```

## Not Null operator

To get the documents where the field is not null, use `$agg.notNull` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  name: $agg.notNull(),
});
```

### Is Null operator

To get the documents where the field is null, use `$agg.isNull` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  name: $agg.isNull(),
});
```

### Between operator

To get the documents where the field is between two values, use `$agg.between` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  score: $agg.between(10, 20),
});
```

### Not between operator

To get the documents where the field is not between two values, use `$agg.notBetween` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.where({
  score: $agg.notBetween(10, 20),
});
```

### Condition Operator

In some scenarios, you want to return a value if a condition is met, and return another value if the condition is not met.

To do so, you can use `$agg.condition` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.select({
  state: $agg.condition($agg.gte(90, "score"), "great", "bad"),
});
```

This will return the value of the `state` based on the users score, if it is greater than or equal 90, it will return `great`, otherwise, it will return `bad`.

> `$agg.cond` method is an alias for `$agg.condition` method.

### Boolean Condition Operator

This is just a an easier way to return `true` if condition is met, and `false` if not.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.select({
  isGoodUser: $agg.booleanCondition($agg.gte(90, "score")),
});
```

### Concat Operator

To concatenate two or more `columns`, use `$agg.concat` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.select({
  fullName: $agg.concat("$firstName", " ", "$lastName"),
});
```

> Please note that here if you want to concat columns, add `$` sign before the column name, otherwise, it will be treated as a string.

### Concat With Operator

To concatenate two or more `columns` with a separator, use `$agg.concatWith` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.select({
  fullName: $agg.concatWith(" ", "firstName", "lastName"),
});
```

You can concatenate as many columns as you want, just pass them as arguments to the `$agg.concat` method.

Here, you don't need to add `$` sign before the column name, because any value will be added after the first argument (`The separator`) will be treated as a column name.

> `$agg.mergeWith` is an alias for `$agg.concatWith` method.

### Year Operator

To get the year of a date, use `$agg.year` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.select({
  year: $agg.year("createdAt"),
});
```

### Month Operator

To get the month of a date, use `$agg.month` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.select({
  month: $agg.month("createdAt"),
});
```

### Day Of Month Operator

To get the day of month of a date, use `$agg.dayOfMonth` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.select({
  dayOfMonth: $agg.dayOfMonth("createdAt"),
});
```

This will return the day of month of the `createdAt` column with `integer` value that represents the day of month.

### Day Of Week Operator

Returns the day of the week for a date as a number between 1 (Sunday) and 7 (Saturday).

To get the day of week of a date, use `$agg.dayOfWeek` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.select({
  dayOfWeek: $agg.dayOfWeek("createdAt"),
});
```

### First Year Operator

To get the first year of a date, use `$agg.firstYear` method, this is useful with `group` stage.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.group(null, {
  year: $agg.firstYear("createdAt"),
});
```

### Last Year Operator

To get the last year of a date, use `$agg.lastYear` method, this is useful with `group` stage.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.group(null, {
  year: $agg.lastYear("createdAt"),
});
```

### First Month Operator

To get the first month of a date, use `$agg.firstMonth` method, this is useful with `group` stage.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.group(null, {
  month: $agg.firstMonth("createdAt"),
});
```

### Last Month Operator

To get the last month of a date, use `$agg.lastMonth` method, this is useful with `group` stage.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.group(null, {
  month: $agg.lastMonth("createdAt"),
});
```

### First Day Of Month Operator

To get the first day of month of a date, use `$agg.firstDayOfMonth` method, this is useful with `group` stage.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.group(null, {
  dayOfMonth: $agg.firstDayOfMonth("createdAt"),
});
```

> Please note that this utility return the first matched value of the day of month not the first day of month of the date.

### Last Day Of Month Operator

To get the last day of month of a date, use `$agg.lastDayOfMonth` method, this is useful with `group` stage.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.group(null, {
  dayOfMonth: $agg.lastDayOfMonth("createdAt"),
});
```

> Please note that this utility return the last matched value of the day of month not the last day of month of the date.

### Push operator

The [Push Operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/push/) is used to add a value to an array.

To use it, use `$agg.push` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.group(null, {
  cities: $agg.push("city"),
});
```

## Columns Utility

If you want to add columns list in the `group` stage, you can use `$agg.columns` method, let's first see an example without using it.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.group(null, {
  country: "$country",
  city: "$city",
});
```

Using `$agg.columns` method, you can write the above code as follows:

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.group(null, $agg.columns("country", "city"));
```

### columnName utility

If you want to make sure that the column is written as it supposed to be `making sure that it starts with $ sign`, you can use `$agg.columnName` method.

```ts
import { $agg, Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users");

const users = await aggregate.project({
  fullName: $agg.concat(
    $agg.columnName("firstName"),
    " ",
    $agg.columnName("lastName")
  ),
});
```

Although it is a little bit long, but could be useful with dynamic column names defined in variables.
