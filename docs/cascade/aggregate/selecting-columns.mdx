# Selecting Columns / Projecting

To select/deselect fields, you can use one of three methods: `select`, `deselect` and `project`.

> Any column in MongoDB accepts dot notation selection by default, so feel free to use it.

## select method

Let's start with `select` method, this method is the most comprehensive and easiest one to use to select or unselect columns.

Method signature:

```ts
  /**
   * Select the given columns
   */
  public select(columns: string[] | Record<string, 0 | 1 | boolean>): Aggregate;
```

The method accepts one of two types:

- `array`: an array of strings, each string is a column name that you want to select.
- `object`: If you want more control to what to select and what not to select use the object instead, this object should have the column name as a key, and the value should be one of the following:
  - `0`: to exclude the column from the result.
  - `1`: to include the column in the result.
  - `true`: to include the column in the result.
  - `false`: to exclude the column from the result.

## deselect method

Deselect method accepts an array of columns `strings` that you want to exclude from the result.

Method signature:

```ts
  /**
   * Deselect the given columns
   */
  public deselect(columns: string[]): Aggregate;
```

## project method

This is the native MongoDB method, it accepts an object that has the column name as a key, and the value could be any acceptable value in [MongoDB Project Stage](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/project/).

Method signature:

```ts
  /**
   * Project the given columns
   */
  public project(columns: Record<string, any>): Aggregate;
```
