# Sorting

Sorting is the process of arranging documents in a collection in a specific order, The `Aggregate` class provides multiple methods to easily sort your documents.

## Sort method

This is the basic method to sort using a single field.

Method Signature:

```ts
public sort(field: string, order?: "asc" | "desc" = "asc"): this;
```

Example:

```ts
const users = await aggregate.sort("age", "desc").get();
```

> `orderBy` is an alias for `sort` method.

## sortByDesc method

This method is an alias for `sort` method with `desc` order.

Method Signature:

```ts
public sortByDesc(field: string): this;
```

Example:

```ts
const users = await aggregate.sortByDesc("age").get();
```

> `orderByDesc` is an alias for `sortByDesc` method.

## Sort By multiple fields

If we want to sort by multiple fields, we can use `sortBy` method.

Method Signature:

```ts
public sortBy(columns: Record<string, "desc" | "asc">): this;
```

Example:

```ts
const users = await aggregate
  .sortBy({
    age: "desc",
    name: "asc",
  })
  .get();
```

This will update documents in the collection to be sorted by `age` in descending order, then by `name` in ascending order.

## Sort randomly

If you want to sort documents randomly, you can use `random` method, however, this method requires a `limit`.

> @see [Sample](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sample/)

Method Signature:

```ts
public random(limit: number): this;
```

Example:

```ts
const users = await aggregate.random(10).get();
```

## Sort by latest

We can use `latest` method to sort documents using `createdAt` field.

> We can not rely on `_id` as it would return unexpected results if we used `_id`

Method Signature:

```ts
public latest(column = "createdAt"): this;
```

Example:

```ts
const users = await aggregate.latest().get();
```

If you want to sort by a different column, you can pass it as the first argument.

## Sort by oldest

Same thing applies here but this time we use `oldest` method, If we need to sort documents by oldest documents first, we can use `oldest` method.

Method Signature:

```ts
public oldest(column = "createdAt"): this;
```

Example:

```ts
const users = await aggregate.oldest().get();
```
