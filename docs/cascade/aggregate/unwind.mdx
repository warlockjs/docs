# Unwind

Unpack an array field from the input documents to output a document for each element.

This is extremely useful specially if you're working with a column that have a list of values or when using `group` stage.

## Method Signature

```ts
public unwind(column: string, {
    includeArrayIndex?: string,
    preserveNullAndEmptyArrays?: boolean
}): this;
```

## Example

```ts
const users = await aggregate.unwind("hobbies").get();
```

By default `preserveNullAndEmptyArrays` is set to `false` this will trim the result to only documents that have the `hobbies` field.
