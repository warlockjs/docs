# Fetching Documents

Fetching documents using Mongez Aggregate class.

## Introduction

As we saw, `Aggregate` is a pipeline that hold multiple stages, we saw how to build the pipeline, now let's see how to fetch the documents.

## Using get method

This is the most common method to fetch documents, it will return an array of documents.

Let's see an example

```ts
import { Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const users = await new Aggregate("users").where("id", ">", 1500).get();
```

This will return list of documents for the users collection.

If we want to map the date before final return, we can pass a callback to the `get` method.

```ts
const users = await new Aggregate("users").get((user) => {
  user.age = new Date().getFullYear() - user.birthYear;
  return user;
});
```

## Get first document

To fetch only first matched document, we can use `first` method.

```ts
const user = await new Aggregate("users").where("id", 1500).first();
```

If no results found, `null` will be returned.

## Get last document

Return last matched document.

```ts
const user = await new Aggregate("users").where("id", 1500).last();
```

## Pagination

Another powerful feature of `Aggregate` is pagination, we can use `paginate` method to paginate the results.

```ts
const results = await new Aggregate("users").paginate(1, 10);
```

The first argument is the page number, and the second argument is the limit.

The results contains an object with the following structure:

```ts
export type PaginationInfo = {
  /**
   * Limit of the query
   */
  limit: number;
  /**
   * Results of the query
   */
  result: number;
  /**
   * Current page of the query
   */
  page: number;
  /**
   * total results of the query
   */
  total: number;
  /**
   * total pages of the query
   */
  pages: number;
};
/**
 * The result of the paginate query
 */
export type PaginationListing<T> = {
  /**
   * Results of the query
   */
  documents: T[];
  /**
   * The pagination results
   */
  paginationInfo: PaginationInfo;
};
```

So basically, it returns `documents` and `paginationInfo` object, the `documents` is an array of documents, and the `paginationInfo` contains the pagination information.

## Count documents

To count the number of documents, we can use `count` method.

```ts
const count = await new Aggregate("users").count();
```

## Chunks

The chunk concept is to split the documents into multiple chunks, this will reduce the loaded documents in the memory especially if we have a large number of documents.

To use chunks, we can use `chunk` method, it receives the `limit` of documents per chunk and a callback to handle the chunk.

```ts
await new Aggregate("users").chunk(100, (users) => {
  // handle the chunk
});
```

You can also receive the `pagination information` in the second callback argument:

```ts
await new Aggregate("users").chunk(100, (users, pagination) => {
  // handle the chunk
});
```

:::danger
If you want to stop the chunking process, you can return `false` from the callback.
:::

## Explain

Sometimes we need to know how the query is executed, we can use `explain` method to get the execution plan of the query.

```ts
const results = await new Aggregate("users").explain();
```

See [explain](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.aggregate/#return-information-on-aggregation-pipeline-operation) for more information.

## Get certain field values

To get certain field values, we can use `values` method.

```ts
const results = await new Aggregate("users").values("name");
```

This will return all values from all documents for the `name` field.

:::tip
Please note that the `values` method will return an array of values, not an array of documents.
:::

:::info
The returned values may return duplicated values, to get unique values, use `unique` method.
:::

## Get Unique/Distinct values for a field

To get unique values for a given field, we can use `unique` method.

```ts
const results = await new Aggregate("users").unique("name");
```

> You can use `distinct` method as an alias for `unique` method.

## Get Heavy Unique/Distinct values for a field

In some scenarios, the unique values may contain `null` value, to ensure only a `non-null` values are returned, we can use `uniqueHeavy` method.

```ts
const results = await new Aggregate("users").uniqueHeavy("name");
```

> You can use `distinctHeavy` method as an alias for `uniqueHeavy` method.
