# Aggregate Class

We had a quick overview over the [MongoDB Aggregate Framework](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/), now let's see how we can use it in our application.

## Create a new Aggregate

Let's start by creating a new Aggregate instance:

```ts
import { Aggregate } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

const aggregate = new Aggregate("users"); // pass the collection name

const usersList = await aggregate.where("id", ">=", 10).get();
```

Consider using the `aggregate` class as a query builder, it will help you build your query in a more readable way.
