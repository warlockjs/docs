# Casting Custom Fields

Casting custom fields are another common use case for custom fields. For example, we need to generate a `slug` field from the `title` field. We can use the `cast` method to cast the `title` field to a `slug` field, because we don't need to add slug field when creating a new post from outside the model.

```ts title="src/models/post.ts"
import { Model, Casts } from "@warlock.js/cascade";
import { sluggable } from "./../utils/casts/sluggable";

export class Post extends Model {
  /**
   * Collection name
   */
  public static collection = "posts";

  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  protected casts: Casts = {
    title: "string",
    content: "string",    
  };

  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
   protected customCasts: CustomCasts = {
    slug: sluggable("title"),
  };
```

The `sluggable` cast is a custom cast that we created to generate a slug from the title. We can use it as follows:

```ts title="src/utils/casts/sluggable.ts"
import { Model } from "@warlock.js/cascade";
import slug from "@mongez/slug";

/**
 * Used for model castings
 */
export function sluggable(field: string) {
  return (model: Model) => {
    let value = model.get(field);

    if (!value) return "";

    return slug(String(value));
  };
}
```

Unlike `casts`, `customCasts` receives directly the model instance in the first argument this is we don't need to pass the field name to the cast function.
