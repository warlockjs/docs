# Create New Document

In the previous section, we've seen how to create a document by creating a new instance of the model then calling the `save` method, this is a way, let's recap it quickly.

## Creating a model

To create a model, you need to extend the `Model` class and define the `collection` property.

```ts title="src/models/user.ts"
import { Model } from "@warlock.js/cascade";

export class User extends Model {
    /**
    * The collection name
    */
    public static collection = "users";
}
```

## Creating a model instance

When creating a new model instance, you optionally pass an object of the data that will be saved (**created**).

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { User } from "./models/user";

const user = new User({
    name: "Hasan Zohdy",
    email: "hassanzohdy@gmail.com",
    isActive: true,
});
```

This only creates an instance of the model, but the data is not saved yet, now let's see how to save the data.

## Saving a model instance

To save a model instance, you need to call the `save` method.

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { User } from "./models/user";

async function main() {
    const user = new User({
        name: "Hasan Zohdy",
        email: "hassanzohdy@gmail.com",
        isActive: true,
    });

    await user.save();

    console.log(user.data); // outputs all data
}
```

## Using the `create` method

A more preferred way to create a new model instance and save it is to use the static `create` method.

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { User } from "./models/user";

async function main() {
    const user = await User.create({
        name: "Hasan Zohdy",
        email: "hassanzohdy@gmail.com",
        isActive: true,
    });

    console.log(user.data); // outputs all data
}
```

This is more easier and cleaner, and it's the **recommended way** to create a new model instance and save it.
