# Fetching Documents

## Introduction

The `Model` class is shipped with powerful methods that allows you to fetch documents from the database, let's see it in depth.

## Getting all documents

To fetch all documents from database, you can use the `list` method:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const users = await User.list();
```

This will fetch all documents from database and return an array of models.

:::warning Not Recommended
This is not recommended to be used if the collection contains a lot of documents, as it will load all documents into memory and may lead to performance issues, use paginate method instead.
:::

## Getting documents with certain filters

To fetch documents with certain filters, you can use the same `list` method but with a filter object:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const users = await User.list({
  isActive: true,
});
```

:::tip
You can add any acceptable syntax to the [find method](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/usage-examples/find/) in MongoDB, you may also add second argument as options.
:::

## Finding Document By Id

To find a document by its id, you can use the `find` method:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const user = await User.find(5123);
```

This will return a single model instance, if no document found, it will return `null`.

:::tip
The `find` method accepts the value of the `id` property not `_id` property.
:::

## Finding Document By certain field

To find a document by certain field, you can use the `findBy` method:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const user = await User.findBy("_id", "5f9d2f5b2c9f6a1e3c9b1b1a");
```

This will return a single model instance, if no document found, it will return `null`.

## Get first document

To get the first document of the collection, you can use the `first` method:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const user = await User.first();
```

You may pass a filter object to the `first` method to get the first document that matches the filter:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const user = await User.first({
  isActive: true,
});
```

## Get last document

To get the last document of the collection, you can use the `last` method:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const user = await User.last();
```

You may pass a filter object to the `last` method to get the last document that matches the filter:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const user = await User.last({
  isActive: true,
});
```

## Count collection documents

To count the number of documents in a collection, you can use the `count` method:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const count = await User.count();
```

You may pass a filter object to the `count` method to count the number of documents that matches the filter:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const count = await User.count({
  isActive: true,
});
```

:::tip
The count method may receive a second argument as options, it accepts the same options as the [countDocuments method](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/usage-examples/count/) in MongoDB.
:::

## Get distinct values

To get distinct values of a field in a collection, you can use the `distinct` method:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const emails = await User.distinct("email");
```

This will return an array of distinct values of the `email` field.

To add more filters, you can pass a filter object as a second argument:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const activeEmails = await User.distinct("email", {
  isActive: true,
});
```

## Explain query

To get the query explanation, you can use the `explain` method:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const explanation = await User.explain({
  isActive: true,
});
```

This will return an object that contains the query explanation.

### Pagination

To paginate the results, you can use the `paginate` method:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

const { documents: users, paginationInfo } = await User.paginate(1, 10);

console.log(paginationInfo);
```

This will return an object that contains the paginated documents and pagination information.

The `paginationInfo` will return an object containing the following schema:

```ts
type PaginationInfo = {
  /**
   * Limit of the query
   */
  limit: number;
  /**
   * Results of the query
   */
  result: number;
  /**
   * Current page of the query
   */
  page: number;
  /**
   * total results of the query
   */
  total: number;
  /**
   * total pages of the query
   */
  pages: number;
};
```

:::success Please Note That
The returned documents are an array of models not plain objects.
:::

## Chunk

To chunk the results, you can use the `chunk` method, the idea here is to split the returned documents into chunks, and pass each chunk to a callback function:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

await User.chunk(10, (users) => {
  console.log(users);
});
```

You may also pass an object of filters, but it **MUST** contain `limit` property:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

await User.chunk(
  {
    limit: 10,
    isActive: true,
  },
  (users) => {
    console.log(users);
  }
);
```

To get the pagination information, you can pass a second callback function:

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user";

await User.chunk(
  {
    limit: 10,
    isActive: true,
  },
  (users) => {
    console.log(users);
  },
  (paginationInfo) => {
    console.log(paginationInfo);
  }
);
```

:::note
To stop executing the chunk, you can return `false` from the callback function.
