# Model Blueprint

Model Blueprint is an extended class of [Blueprint](./blueprint) that allows you to create indexes on your models.

Any model has by default its own blueprint, so you can use it to create indexes on your models.

## Usage

To get a blueprint for a model, use the static `blueprint` method from the model class.

```ts
import { User } from "./models/user.ts";

const userBlueprint = User.blueprint();
```

From this point, all methods located in the [Blueprint Class](./blueprint) are available to use.
