# Introduction

Let's dive deep into more advanced concepts of the package that would make you understand the package more.

## Auto Increment

By default Mongodb has its own `_id`, but mostly we want a numeric `id` instead of the default `_id` that mongodb provides, this is where the `autoIncrement` comes in handy.

See how it works in this package in [Auto Increment](./auto-increment) section.

## Master Mind

Master mind is helper class that is used exclusively to manage the id in the models, have a look at [Master Mind](./master-mind) section to learn more about it.
