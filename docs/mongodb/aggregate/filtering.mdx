# Filtering

Perform filtering on your data using the `where` methods.

Mongez Aggregate class provides various methods to filter your data.

## where

The `where` method is used to filter documents based on a condition. It could take multiple forms:

```ts
  /**
   * Add where stage
   */
  public where(column: string, value: any): this;
  public where(column: string, operator: WhereOperator, value: any): this;
  public where(column: Record<string, any>): this;
```

Let's have a look at each one of them:

### Simple where stage

If you just want to filter documents based on a single value equality, you can do this:

```ts
const users = await aggregate.where("id", 10).get();
```

Just pass the column name and the value you want to filter by.

### Where with operator

Alternatively, if you want to make more conditions, you can use the operator, here are the available operators:

```ts
const whereOperators = [
  "=",
  "!=",
  "not",
  ">",
  ">=",
  "<",
  "<=",
  "in",
  "nin",
  "notIn",
  "all",
  "exists",
  "type",
  "mod",
  "regex",
  "geoIntersects",
  "geoWithin",
  "near",
  "between",
  "notBetween",
  "nearSphere",
  "elemMatch",
  "size",
  "like",
  "notLike",
  "startsWith",
  "endsWith",
];
```

It could be any of the previous operators, let's take some examples:

```ts
const users = await aggregate.where("id", ">", 10).get();
const users = await aggregate.where("id", "in", [1, 2, 3]).get();
const users = await aggregate.where("id", "between", [1, 10]).get();
```

### Where with object

Another way to filter documents is to pass an object to the `where` method, this object should have the column name as a key, and the value should be the value you want to filter by.

Method signature:

```ts
public where(column: Record<string, any>): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.where({ id: 10 }).get();
```

You can also use the built-in Mongodb operators:

```ts
const users = await aggregate.where({ id: { $gt: 10 } }).get();
```

:::tip Did you know?
You can use [$agg utility](./agg) to easily use built-in operators directly.

## Where null

If you want to filter documents based on a null value, you can use the `whereNull` method:

Method signature:

```ts
public whereNull(column: string): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereNull("id").get();
```

This will return all users that have `id = null`.

## Where not null

If you want to filter documents based on a not null value, you can use the `whereNotNull` method:

Method signature:

```ts
public whereNotNull(column: string): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereNotNull("id").get();
```

## Where in

If you want to filter documents based on a list of values, you can use the `whereIn` method:

Method signature:

```ts
public whereIn(column: string, value: any[]): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereIn("id", [1, 2, 3]).get();
```

If the second argument is a string, then it will be treated as a `column name`.

## Where not in

If you want to filter documents based on a list of values, you can use the `whereNotIn` method:

Method signature:

```ts
public whereNotIn(column: string, value: any[]): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereNotIn("id", [1, 2, 3]).get();
```

If the second argument is a string, then it will be treated as a `column name`.

## Where between

If you want to filter documents based on a range of values, you can use the `whereBetween` method:

Method signature:

```ts
public whereBetween(column: string, value: [any, any]): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereBetween("id", [1, 10]).get();
```

## Where not between

If you want to filter documents based on a range of values, you can use the `whereNotBetween` method:

Method signature:

```ts
public whereNotBetween(column: string, value: [any, any]): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereNotBetween("id", [1, 10]).get();
```

## Where like

If you want to filter documents based on a string pattern, you can use the `whereLike` method:

Method signature:

```ts
public whereLike(column: string, value: string): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereLike("name", "John").get();
```

This will return all users that have `name` column that contains `John`.

> If the second argument is a string, the value will be case-insensitive.

You can also pass a `regex` object:

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereLike("name", /John/i).get();
```

## Where not like

If you want to filter documents based on a string pattern, you can use the `whereNotLike` method:

Method signature:

```ts
public whereNotLike(column: string, value: string): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereNotLike("name", "John").get();
```

This will return all users that have `name` column that does not contain `John`.

> If the second argument is a string, the value will be case-insensitive.

## Where starts with

If you want to filter documents based on a string pattern, you can use the `whereStartsWith` method:

Method signature:

```ts
public whereStartsWith(column: string, value: string): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereStartsWith("name", "John").get();
```

This will return all users that have `name` column that starts with `John`.

> The value will be case-sensitive.

## Where ends with

If you want to filter documents based on a string pattern, you can use the `whereEndsWith` method:

Method signature:

```ts
public whereEndsWith(column: string, value: string): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereEndsWith("name", "John").get();
```

This will return all users that have `name` column that ends with `John`.

> The value will be case-sensitive.

## Where date between

If you want to filter documents based on a date range, you can use the `whereDateBetween` method:

Method signature:

```ts
public whereDateBetween(column: string, value: [Date, Date]): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate
  .whereDateBetween("createdAt", [
    new Date("2020-01-01"),
    new Date("2020-12-31"),
  ])
  .get();
```

## Where date not between

Filter documents that are not between a date range.

Method signature:

```ts
public whereDateNotBetween(column: string, value: [Date, Date]): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate
  .whereDateNotBetween("createdAt", [
    new Date("2020-01-01"),
    new Date("2020-12-31"),
  ])
  .get();
```

## Where exists

This method will filter documents based on the existence of a column.

Method signature:

```ts
public whereExists(column: string): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereExists("name").get();
```

## Where not exists

This method will filter documents based on the existence of a column.

Method signature:

```ts
public whereNotExists(column: string): this;
```

```ts
const users = await aggregate.whereNotExists("name").get();
```

## Where near

This method will filter documents based on the distance between two points.

## Or Where

If we need to filter if any of the conditions is true, we can use `orWhere` method.

```ts
const users = await aggregate
  .orWhere({
    id: 10,
    name: "John",
  })
  .get();
```

This will return all users that have either `id = 10` or `name = John`.

You can also use the [$agg utility](./agg) to use built-in operators:

Before:

```ts
const users = await aggregate
  .orWhere({
    id: { $gt: 10 },
    name: { $regex: /john/i },
  })
  .get();
```

After:

```ts
import { $agg } from "@mongez/mongodb";

const users = await aggregate
  .orWhere({
    id: $agg.gt(10),
    name: $agg.like("john"),
  })
  .get();
```
