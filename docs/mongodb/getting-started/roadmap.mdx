# Road Map

This document will guide you where to start and what to do next.

## Terminology

Before we get started with our Road Map, let's talk about some terminology that we will be using throughout the documentation.

- `collection`: A collection is set of documents in database, in SQL databases it is called `table`.
- `document`: A document a set of data that combined in one object, you may visualize it like a json object, a document is a single record in the collection, in SQL databases it is called `row`.
- `field`: A field is a single property of a document, in SQL databases it is called `column`.
- `query`: A query is a request to the database to perform an action, in SQL databases it is called `query` as well.
- `model`: A model is a class that manages a collection's document.
- `schema`: A schema is the blueprint of a collection in the database, it defines the fields and their types.
- `aggregate`: An aggregate is a pipeline of stages that perform a set of operations on the documents in the collection.
- `CRUD`: CRUD is an acronym for `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`, it is a set of operations that can be performed on a document in a collection.
- `pagination`: Pagination is a technique to split the results of a query into multiple pages, it is used to reduce the amount of data that is returned from the database, this is useful when you have a large amount of data.
- `explain`: Explain is a method that returns information about the query execution, it is useful for debugging and optimizing queries.
- `upsert`: Upsert is a method that updates a document if it exists, otherwise it creates a new document.

Now let's get started.

## 1. Installation

Of course you would need to install the package first. You can do that by following the [installation guide](./installation).

## 2. Connecting To Database & Configuration

Next, we need to establish our database connection and set the package configurations, you can do that by following the [connecting to database guide](./connecting-to-database).

## 3. Basic CRUD Operations

Now that we have our database connection established, we can start doing some basic CRUD operations. Let's start with the most basic one, [creating a record](./../queries/introduction).

## 4. Understanding Models

Let's start with the most important part [models](./../models/introduction).
