# Model Id

## Introduction

Model `id` is an integer field that is auto-incremented by default, which is fully managed by the model class, you can manually assign value to it or manually generate it as well.

:::tip
The id is generated if and only if the model does not have an `id` value in its data, this means it works only with newly created models.
:::

## Auto Incrementing

By default, the `id` field is auto-incremented, which means that when saving a new model, the `id` field will be automatically generated, let's take an example:

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { Category } from "./models/category";

async function main() {
  const category = new Category({
    name: "Sports",
  });

  await category.save();

  console.log(category.id); // 512344
}

main();
```

This will auto generate a random id for the model by default.

## Auto Incrementing with a custom start value

By default the initial id value is randomly generated for an integer between `10000` and `499999`, you can change this value by setting the `initialId` property in the model class, let's take an example:

```ts title="src/models/category.ts"
import { Model } from "@mongez/mongodb";

export class Category extends Model {
  /**
   * The collection name
   */
  public static collection = "categories";

  /**
   * The initial id value
   */
  public static initialId = 1;
}
```

This will start the auto incrementing from `1` instead of a random value.

## The next auto generated id

Same applies to the next generated id, it is generated randomly and sums the initial id with a random number between `1000` and `9999`, you can change this value by setting the `incrementIdBy` property in the model class, let's take an example:

```ts title="src/models/category.ts"
import { Model } from "@mongez/mongodb";

export class Category extends Model {
  /**
   * The collection name
   */
  public static collection = "categories";

  /**
   * The initial id value
   */
  public static initialId = 1;

  /**
   * The increment value
   */
  public static incrementIdBy = 1;
}
```

In that example, our category model will mostly interact exactly like the typical auto incrementing id in SQL databases, however, for large scale applications, it is recommended to use a random id instead of an auto incrementing one so guessing the next id will be impossible.

## Manually Generating the next ID

In some scenarios, you might need to generate the next id even before saving the model, to achieve this we can use the `generateNextId` method, let's take an example:

```ts title="src/app.ts"
import { Category } from "./models/category";

async function main() {
  const category = new Category({
    name: "Sports",
  });

  const nextId = await category.generateNextId();

  console.log(nextId); // 512344
  console.log(category.id); // 512344
}

main();
```

This will generate the next id and assign it to the `id` property of the model.
