# Localization Utils

This section of documentation covers various functions that can be used for localization.

## Get Localized Value

`getLocalized` is a function that receives an array of [Localized data](./introduction#Localized-data) and returns the value of the given locale code.

```ts title="src/app/main.ts"
import { getLocalized } from "@warlock.js/core";

const name = [
  {
    localeCode: "en",
    value: "John Doe",
  },
  {
    localeCode: "ar",
    value: "جون دو",
  },
];

console.log(getLocalized(name, "en")); // returns "John Doe"
```

This could be handy function if you want to retrieve the value of a localized data but not to wait to the output to convert it based on current locale code.

If the second argument is not passed and the function is called within a [Request Context](./../http/request-context) then it will return the value of the current locale code.

```ts title="src/app/posts/controllers/get-post.ts"
import { getLocalized, Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { Post } from "app/posts/models/post";

export default async function getPost(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const post = await Post.find(request.params.id);

  return {
    title: getLocalized(post.title),
    content: getLocalized(post.content),
  };
}
```
