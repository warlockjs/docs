# Introduction

Mails play a crucial role in any application, it's used to send notifications, welcome emails, and many other use cases.

Warlock provides a simple way to send emails using [NodeMailer](https://nodemailer.com).

## Setup

By default Warlock installs **nodemailer** so you don't need to install it manually.

Now just head to the [Mail Configurations](./configurations) file, and set your mail configurations.

## Sending Emails

After we configured the mailer, we can now send emails using the `sendMail` function.

```ts
import { sendMail } from "@warlock.js/core";

sendMail({
  to: "your-email@exampl.com",
  subject: "Welcome to Warlock",
  html: "<h1>Welcome to Warlock</h1>",
});
```

The `sendMail` function accepts an object that contains the following properties:

- `to`: The email address of the recipient.
- `subject`: The email subject.
- `html`: The email body, it could be a string or an HTML string.
- `text`: The email body, it should be only a plain text.
- `attachments`: An array of attachments, each attachment is an object that contains the following properties:
  - `filename`: The file name.
  - `path`: The file path.
  - `content`: The file content.
  - `encoding`: The file encoding, the default value is `utf-8`.
  - `contentType`: The file content type, the default value is `text/plain`.
  - `cid`: The file content id, the default value is `null`.
- `from`: it is optional as it will be taken from the mail configurations, but you can override it here.
- `cc`: An array of email addresses to be added to the `cc` field.
- `bcc`: An array of email addresses to be added to the `bcc` field.

## React Mails

[React](https://reactjs.org) is a popular library to build user interfaces, and it's used in many applications.

Luckily, Warlock uses a simple react component to render the email body, so you can use react to build your emails.

## Send a react mail

To send a react mail, use `sendReactMail`, it takes everything that `sendMail` takes, except the html is replaced by `render` property

```tsx title="src/app/users/mail/verifyEmail.tsx"
import { sendReactMail } from "@warlock.js/core";
import EmailVerification from "./../components/EmailVerification";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function sendVerificationMail(user: User) {
  await sendReactMail({
    to: user.email,
    subject: "Verify your email",
    render: <EmailVerification user={user} />,
  });
}
```

Now define the `EmailVerification` component:

```tsx title="src/app/users/components/EmailVerification.tsx"
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export default function EmailVerification({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Verify your email</h1>
      <p>
        Hello {user.name}, please click the following link to verify your email
        address.
      </p>
      <p>Your verification code is: {user.get("activationCode")}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Using Styled Components

The project is installed with [Emotion Styled Components](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) so you can use it to style your emails.

```tsx title="src/app/users/components/EmailVerification.tsx"
import { User } from "./../models/user";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

const Container = styled.div`
  background: #f5f5f5;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
`;

export default function EmailVerification({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <Container>
      <h1>Verify your email</h1>
      <p>
        Hello {user.name}, please click the following link to verify your email
        address.
      </p>
      <p>Your verification code is: {user.get("activationCode")}</p>
    </Container>
  );
}
```

:::note
Please note that not all CSS properties are supported in emails, so make sure to check the [Supported CSS Properties](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/) before using any CSS property.

You can of course remove it if you don't need it.
