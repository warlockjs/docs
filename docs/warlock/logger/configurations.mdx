# Logging Configurations

To set logging configurations, modify `src/config/log.ts` file.

```ts title="src/config/log.ts"
import { ConsoleLog } from "@mongez/logger";
import { LogConfigurations } from "@warlock.js/core";

const consoleLog = new ConsoleLog();

const logConfigurations: LogConfigurations = {
  enabled: true,
  channels: [consoleLog],
};

export default logConfigurations;
```

This will enable the console logger, and set it as the default logger.

You can add more channels to the `channels` array from [Mongez Logger](https://github.com/hassanzohdy/logger) based on your needs.

## Enable logging

By default logging is enabled in the application, you can control this behavior by setting the `enabled` property in the logger configurations.

## Environment channels

If we want to set different channels for different environments, then add the environment property in our exported object.

```ts title="src/config/log.ts"
import { FileLog, ConsoleLog } from "@mongez/logger";
import { LogConfigurations } from "@warlock.js/core";

const consoleLog = new ConsoleLog();
const fileLog = new FileLog();

const logConfigurations: LogConfigurations = {
  enabled: true,
  channels: [consoleLog],
  production: {
    channels: [
      fileLog,
      ],
    },
  },
};

export default logConfigurations;
```

In this case, the console logger will be used in all environments except the production environment, where the file logger will be used instead for production only.
