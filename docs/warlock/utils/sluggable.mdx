# Sluggable

`sluggable` is a custom-cast function that generates a slug from model's value i.e `name` field.

It works with strings and localized values as well.

## Usage

In your post model, add the following:

```ts title="src/app/posts/models/post.ts"
import { Model, Casts } from "@mongez/monpulse";
import { sluggable } from "@mongez/warlock";

export class Post extends Model {
  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  protected casts: Casts = {
    title: "localized",
    description: "localized",
    shortDescription: "localized",
    isActive: "boolean",
  };

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  protected customCasts = {
    slug: sluggable("title"),
  };
}
```

This will generate `slug` value every time the post is saved.

If the `title` field is localized, the slug will be generated from the english locale code (`en`).
