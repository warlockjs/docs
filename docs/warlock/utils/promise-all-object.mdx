# Promise All Object

`promiseAllObject` is a utility function that allows you to run multiple promises at once, and return the results as an object.

This is a more convenient way to use `Promise.all` when you need to return the results as an object.

## Usage

In anywhere in your code, you can use the `promiseAllObject` function as follows:

```ts title="src/app/posts/controllers/get-posts.ts"
import { promiseAllObject, Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import postsRepository from "./../repositories/posts";
import categoriesRepository from "app/categories/repositories/categories";

export default async function getPosts(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const { posts, categories } = await promiseAllToObject({
    categories: categoriesRepository.all(),
    posts: postsRepository.all(),
  });
  // rest of the code
}
```

:::note
Please note that you should not use the `await` keyword beside each promise, because `promiseAllObject` will do that for you.
