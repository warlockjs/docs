# Sleep

`sleep` is a utility function that allows you to pause the execution of the code for a specific amount of time.

## Usage

In anywhere in your code, you can use the `sleep` function as follows:

```ts title="src/app/posts/controllers/get-posts.ts"
import { sleep, Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export default async function getPosts(request: Request, response: Response) {
  await sleep(1000);

  // rest of the code
}
```

:::note
The `sleep` function takes the time in milliseconds.
