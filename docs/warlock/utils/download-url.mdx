# Download url

`downloadFileFromUrl` is a function that receives three parameters:

- `url`: The url of the file to download.
- `destination`: The destination path to save the file to.
- `fileName`: Optionally The file name to save the file with.

It fetches the file from the given url and saves it to the given destination path.

## Usage

```ts title="src/app/posts/controllers/get-posts.ts"
import {
  storagePath,
  downloadFileFromUrl,
  Request,
  Response,
} from "@warlock.js/core";

export default async function getPosts(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const response = await downloadFileFromUrl(
    "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    storagePath("images")
  );

  // rest of the code
}
```

If the third argument is not passed, then the function will generate a random file name but keep the file extension.

The output of the function is [AxiosResponse](https://github.com/axios/axios#response-schema).

:::danger
The function will throw an error if the given url is not valid.
:::

:::warning
The function is not going to create the directory if it doesn't exist, so make sure to create it before calling the function.
