## The Backend For Frontend (BFF)

When `Warlock` was designed, its primary focus was to ensure ease of use for frontend developers, minimizing the need for in-depth backend knowledge. This approach accelerates frontend application development, enabling teams to proceed without being dependent on backend progress.

By leveraging `Warlock`, frontend developers can expedite their workflow and deliver high-quality applications swiftly, without having to wait for backend tasks to be completed. This framework streamlines the development process, empowering frontend teams to work autonomously and efficiently.
