# Database Decorators

Decorators are a way to add metadata to a class, property, or method declaration, and make the class, property, or method declaration more expressive.

## Sluggable

The `Sluggable` decorator is used to generate a slug from a string property, it uses under the hood [sluggable](./../utils/sluggable) utility function.

### Example

```ts title="src/app/products/models/product.ts"
import { castModel, Casts, Model } from "@warlock.js/cascade";
import { Sluggable, uploadable } from "@warlock.js/core";

@Sluggable("title")
export default class Post extends Model {
  // ...

  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  protected casts: Casts = {
    title: "localized",
    description: "localized",
    shortDescription: "localized",
    isActive: "boolean",
  };
}
```

This will create `slug` field whenever the post is saved (created or updated), the slug will be generated from the `title` field.

You can generate the slug from another column by passing the column name to the `Sluggable` decorator.

```ts title="src/app/products/models/product.ts"
import { castModel, Casts, Model } from "@warlock.js/cascade";
import { Sluggable, uploadable } from "@warlock.js/core";

@Sluggable("name")
export default class Post extends Model {
  // ...

  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  protected casts: Casts = {
    name: "localized",
    description: "localized",
    shortDescription: "localized",
    isActive: "boolean",
  };
}
```
