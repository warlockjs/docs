# Guests

Guests are users that are not logged in, but has a `JWT`.

## How it works

When a user visits the website for the first time, a `JWT` is generated for him, and this token is sent to the user, and the user will send this token with every request to the server.

## Define guest route

To generate an access token for guests, define a route inside the `routes` file in users directory

```ts title="src/app/users/routes.ts"
import { router, Request, Response, guestLogin } from "@warlock.js/core";

router.post("/login/guests", guestLogin);

// rest of the routes
```

The `guestLogin` function will generate a `JWT` for the user and send it to him.

## Guest Model

Guests have separate collection with `Guest` model (guests collection in database) that has basically just the guest id.

Each guest model returns the following response:

```json
{
  "id": "int",
  "userType": "guest"
}
```

The `userType` is used to differentiate between guests and logged in users.

Every guest model extends [Auth Model](./auth-model.mdx) to inherit all access token related methods.

## Extending Guest Model

You can extend the guest model to modify or set the output data when called inside guest login.

```ts title="src/app/users/models/guest.ts"
import { Guest as BaseGuest } from "@warlock.js/core";

export class Guest extends BaseGuest {
  // do your stuff here
}
```

Now modify the `auth.userType` configurations to use the new guest model.

```ts {5} title="src/config/auth.ts"
import { AuthConfigurations } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { Guest } from "app/users/models/guest";

const authConfigurations: AuthConfigurations = {
  userType: {
    guest: Guest,
    // other user types
  },
  // rest of the configurations
};
```
