# Auth Model

Auth model is an `abstract` class that is used for generating and validating access tokens.

## Extending Auth Model

The primary use case for extending the auth model is to manage access tokens and password.

## Generate Access Token

The `User` model that extends the `Auth` model can use `generateAccessToken` when the user logs in.

## Verifying user credentials

To verify the user credentials, you can use the `attempt` method from `Auth` model.

This method accepts an object that will be used to fetch the user from the database, the only required key in the object is the `password` that will not be used to fetch the user, but will be used to verify the user password.

## Login Example

Consider the following example:

```ts {7,24} title="src/app/users/controllers/login.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "../models/user";

export default async function login(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const user: User = request.user;

  const token = await user.generateAccessToken();

  return response.success({
    user: {
      accessToken: token,
      ...(await user.toJSON()),
    },
  });
}

login.validation = {
  rules: {
    email: ["required", "email"],
    password: ["required"],
  },
  validate: async (request: Request, response: Response) => {
    // verify the user credentials
    const user = await User.attempt(request.only(["email", "password"]));

    if (!user) {
      return response.badRequest({
        error: "Invalid credentials",
      });
    }

    if (!user.isActive) {
      return response.badRequest({
        error: "Your account is not active",
      });
    }

    request.user = user;
  },
};
```

We started the `validate` method by verifying the user credentials using `User.attempt` method, this method will return `null` if the user is not found or the password is incorrect.

If the user is found, we check if the user is active, if not, we return an error.

> This is an optional step based on your application logic.

## Removing Access Token

This will be handy in the `logout` request, so we can remove the access token from the database.

```ts {7} title="src/app/users/controllers/logout.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "../models/user";

export default async function logout(
  request: Request<User>,
  response: Response
) {
  const user: User = request.user;

  await user.removeAccessToken();

  delete request.user;

  return response.success();
}
```
