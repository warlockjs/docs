# JWT

JWT stands for JSON Web Token, it's a standard for creating access tokens that can be used for authentication.

## Generating JWT

Access token are tightly coupled with users models such as `User` and `Guest` which both should extends [Auth Model](./auth-model).

The `Auth` model has a `generateAccessToken` method that creates and store the access token in the database related to that user.

## Manually generating JWT

If you would like to generate an access token away from the Auth model, you can import `jwt` object from `Warlock`

```ts title="src/app/main.ts"
import { jwt } from "@warlock.js/core";

async function main() {
  const token = await jwt.generate({
    id: 1,
    userType: "user",
  });
}
```

This will generate a JWT for the user with id `1` and type `user`.

:::note
JWT is generating using [Fastify JWT](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-jwt) so any options supported by it can be passed to the `generate` method.
:::

## Verifying JWT

To validate a JWT, you can use the `verify` method from `jwt` object.

```ts title="src/app/main.ts"
import { jwt } from "@warlock.js/core";

async function main() {
  const token = await jwt.verify("token");
}
```

## Storing Access Tokens

Kindly note that `jwt.generate` does not store the access token in the database, it just generates it, so you need to store it manually.

By default `Warlock` has `AccessToken` model that is being used by [Auth Model](./auth-model) to store the access token in the database.
