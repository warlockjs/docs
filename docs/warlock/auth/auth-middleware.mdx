# Auth Middleware

Auth middleware is used to verify the user identity, it's used to protect routes from unauthorized access.

## Usage

Import `auth` middleware from `@mongez/warlock` and use it in the route definition.

```ts title="src/app/users/routes.ts"
import { router, authMiddleware } from "@mongez/warlock";
import { listUsers } from "./controllers/list-users";

router.get("/users", listUsers, {
  middleware: authMiddleware(),
});
```

The `authMiddleware` will authenticate the current request by verifying the `JWT` token sent with the request.

## Protected Routes for user type

The previous example works for any type of users either an actual user or a [Guest](./guests) user.

Now what if we want to protect a route for a specific user type?

For example, the `update profile` api requires an actual user not a guest user, in this case we can use the `authMiddleware` and pass to it the user type defined in [Auth configurations](./configurations).

```ts title="src/app/users/routes.ts"
import { router, authMiddleware } from "@mongez/warlock";
import { updateProfile } from "./controllers/update-profile";

router.post("/users/profile", updateProfile, {
  middleware: authMiddleware("user"),
});
```

This will allow only the user with `userType` equals to **user** to access this route.

We can also use it for reverse guarded, for example, a logged in user can not make a login, create account or forget password request, so we can use the `authMiddleware` to guard these routes for guests only.

```ts title="src/app/users/routes.ts"
import { router, authMiddleware } from "@mongez/warlock";
import { login } from "./controllers/login";
import { createAccount } from "./controllers/create-account";
import { forgetPassword } from "./controllers/forget-password";

router.group(
  {
    middleware: [authMiddleware("guest")],
  },
  () => {
    router.post("/login", login);
    router.post("/create-account", createAccount);
    router.post("/forget-password", forgetPassword);
  }
);
```

We used the router group method to add the `authMiddleware` to all routes inside the group.

:::tip
All of these groups are already stored in `src/app/utils/router.ts`.
