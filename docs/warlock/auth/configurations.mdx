# Auth configurations

Auth configurations are basically related to current user either it is a logged in user or a guest user, warlock embraces the concept of guest users, so it is important to define the guest user configurations.

- `userType`: The user type model, it's used to identify the current user type, it's required when using [Auth Middleware](./../auth/auth-middleware).
- `jwt.secret`: JWT Secret key to sign and verify the JWT token.

### User Types

[Auth Middleware](./../auth/auth-middleware) requires a user type that should be defined inside the `auth.userType` configurations, so it can identifies the current model to work with it.

For default installation, there are two user types: `User` and `Guest` models, but you can add more user types, and you can define the default user type.

Each key inside the `auth.userType` represents the user type name, and the value represents the user type model.

:::info
Each user type MUST extend [Auth model](./../auth/auth-model) because it generates and stores the JWT token
:::

```ts title="src/config/auth.ts"
import { AuthConfigurations, Guest } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "app/users/models/user";

const authConfigurations: AuthConfigurations = {
  userType: {
    guest: Guest,
    user: User,
  },
  jwt: {
    secret: "secret",
  },
};

export default authConfigurations;
```

Guest is a simple model that extends the [Auth model](./../auth/auth-model) and it's used to identify the guest user.

## JWT Configurations

Any options supported by [Fastify JWT](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-jwt) can be passed to the `jwt` object.

### Secret Key

The jwt secret key is generated automatically inside the `.env` file, so make sure to change it in the production environment.

Secret key can be primitive (string) or can be an object contains `public` and `private` keys, it's used to sign and verify the JWT token.

This is the only required option for JWT configurations.

Check the [JWT Documentation](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-jwt#secret-required) for more information.
