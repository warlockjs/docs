# Introduction

Almost no application is complete without uploading files, especially images, this section is all about images.

## Setup

Warlock is shipped with [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com) which is a high performance Node.js image processing library.

## Upload an image

When [Uploading images](./../upload/compressing-images) and with the **compress** mode activated, Warlock uses Sharp to compress the images.

## Manual image processing

Warlock provides a simple way to process images using Sharp by wrapping the `Sharp` class by Warlock `Image` class.

## Basic Usage

To use the `Image` class, import it from `@warlock.js/core`:

```ts title="src/app/main.ts"
import { storagePath, Image } from "@warlock.js/core";

async function main() {
  const imagePath = storagePath("images/image.jpg");

  const image = new Image(imagePath);
}

main();
```

Now let's resize the image:

```ts title="src/app/main.ts"
import { storagePath, Image } from "@warlock.js/core";

async function main() {
  const imagePath = storagePath("images/image.jpg");

  const image = new Image(imagePath);

  image.resize(200, 200);

  await image.save(storagePath("images/resized-image.jpg"));
}
```

Here we resized the image to 200x200, and saved it to `storage/images/resized-image.jpg`.

## Watermark

Another good and important feature is to add watermarks in the images, luckily, Warlock provides a simple way to do that.

```ts title="src/app/main.ts"
import { storagePath, Image } from "@warlock.js/core";

async function main() {
  const imagePath = storagePath("images/image.jpg");

  const image = new Image(imagePath);

  await image.watermark(storagePath("images/watermark.png"), {
    gravity: "northwest",
  });

  await image.save(storagePath("images/watermarked-image.jpg"));
}
```

The `watermark` method accepts the watermark image path or an instance of `Image` class.

## Multiple Watermarks

In some situations, you may need to add multiple watermarks to the image, for example, you may need to add a watermark to the top left corner, and another one to the bottom right corner.

To do that, you can use the `watermarks` method:

```ts title="src/app/main.ts"
import { storagePath, Image } from "@warlock.js/core";
import watermarkImage1 from "./../images/watermark-1.png";
import watermarkImage2 from "./../images/watermark-2.png";
import image from "./../images/image.jpg";

async function main() {
  const imagePath = storagePath("images/image.jpg");

  const image = new Image(imagePath);

  await image.watermarks([
    {
      image: watermarkImage1,
      gravity: "northwest",
    },
    {
      image: watermarkImage2,
      gravity: "southeast",
    },
  ]);

  await image.save(storagePath("images/watermarked-image.jpg"));
}
```
