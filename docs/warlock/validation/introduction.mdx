# Introduction

Validation is a common task in web applications, it's used to validate the user input, and make sure it's valid before processing it.

## How it works

There are two ways of validating a request, either by using [Validation Rules](#validation-rules) or by using [Custom Validator](#custom-validator).

Each request handler can add it's validation criteria by extending the function with a static property called `validation`.

The `validation` object has two keys:

- `rules`: An object that contains the validation rules, which acts exactly like a [validation rules](./validation-rules).
- `validate`: A function that accepts the request and response objects, which acts exactly like a [middleware](./../http/middleware).

## Validation Rules

Validation rules are rules that are used to validate the request input, it's used to validate the request body, query, and params.

## Custom Validator

Consider a custom validator as the final middleware interceptor before processing the request, it's used to validate the request after the validation rules.

## Example

Let's consider using the login request as an example:

```ts title="src/app/users/routes.ts"
import { router } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { login } from "./controllers/auth/login";

router.post("/login", login);
```

Now let's head to `src/app/users/controllers/auth/login.ts` and see what's inside:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/auth/login.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "app/users/models/user";

export default async function login(request: Request, response: Response) {
  // do logic here
}

login.validation = {
  rules: {
    email: ["required", "email"],
    password: ["required", "string"],
  },
  validate: async (request: Request, response: Response) => {
    // custom validation here
    const user = await User.attempt(request.only(["email", "password"]));

    if (!user) {
      return response.unauthorized();
    }

    // inject the user object to the request object
    // Make sure to not return a value, otherwise the request will be terminated
    request.user = user;
  },
};
```
