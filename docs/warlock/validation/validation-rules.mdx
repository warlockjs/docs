# Validation Rules

Validation rules are used to validate the request input, it's used to validate the request body, query, and params.

## How it works

Each handler can have special property called `validation`, this property is an object that has two keys:

- `rules`: An object of validation rules.
- `validate`: [A Custom validator](./custom-validator)

## Example

Let's take an example of validating the login request:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/auth/login.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "app/users/models/user";

export default async function login(request: Request, response: Response) {
  // do logic here
}

login.validation = {
  rules: {
    email: ["required", "email"],
    password: ["required", "string"],
  },
};
```

In our previous handler, we added `login.validation`, the validator object with `rules` object.

The `rules` object has two keys **email** and **password**, each key has an array of validation rules.

## Defining Validation Rules

There are two ways to use validation rules, either by passing the validation rule name as a string, or by passing a rule object.

All validation rules has its own name, but it must be defined in the [Validation configurations](./configurations). under the rules object.

Each key inside the `rules` object will be used as the rule name indicator, for example:

```ts
import {
  EmailRule,
  InRule,
  LengthRule,
  MaxLengthRule,
  MinLengthRule,
  RequiredRule,
  StringRule,
  ValidationConfigurations,
} from "@warlock.js/core";

const validationConfigurations: ValidationConfigurations = {
  rules: {
    required: RequiredRule,
    string: StringRule,
    in: InRule,
    minLength: MinLengthRule,
    length: LengthRule,
    maxLength: MaxLengthRule,
    email: EmailRule,
  },
  // ...
};

export default validationConfigurations;
```

In the previous example, we defined the validation rules that we will use in our application.

So to use the Email rule for instance, it is mapped with `email` key, so we can use it as a string:

```ts {3}
login.validation = {
  rules: {
    email: ["required", "email"],
    password: ["required", "string"],
  },
};
```

## Using Rule Object

Another way to use the validation rules is by passing the rule object instead of the rule name, mostly this is used with [UniqueRule](./rules/unique) and [ExistsRule](./rules/exists).

For example, let's consider the following example:

```ts
import { ExistsRule } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "app/users/models/user";

login.validation = {
  rules: {
    email: ["required", "email", new ExistsRule(User)],
    password: ["required", "string"],
  },
};
```

In the previous example, we used the `ExistsRule` with the `User` model, so the rule will check if the user exists in the database or not.

## Validation Rules List

By default, `Warlock` is shipped with `+30` validation rules.

To see the full list of validation rules, please head to [Validation Rules List](./rules/rules-list).

## Create Your Own Validation Rule

You can create your own validation rule, please head to [Create Your Own Validation Rule](./rules/create-your-own-rule).

## Passing options to validation rules

Any validation rule can receive options (if the rule requires that) by adding `:` after the rule name, and passing the options as a string.

For example, `minLength` requires a value to be passed, so we can pass it like this:

```ts
login.validation = {
  rules: {
    email: ["required", "email"],
    password: ["required", "string", "minLength:8"],
  },
};
```

To set the options using Rule object,pass an array of options to `setOptions` method.

For example, let's consider the following example:

```ts
import { MinLengthRule } from "@warlock.js/core";

login.validation = {
  rules: {
    email: ["required", "email"],
    password: ["required", "string", new MinLengthRule().setOptions([8])],
  },
};
```

## Validation error messages

All validation rules are stored under `validation` group name, by default it supports `English` and `Arabic` languages, you can however add your own language.

### ]Default error messages

To override an error message from the default messages, you can use the `groupedTranslations` function, for example:

```ts title="src/app/general/utils/locales.ts"
import { groupedTranslation } from "@mongez/localization";

groupedTranslation("validation", {
  required: {
    en: ":input is mandatory",
    ar: "يجب ان يحتوي على قيمة :input",
  },
});
```

## Translated input names

Let's say our current app locale code is `ar` which is Arabic, now we want to return an error for `firstName` that indicates it is required which is defined in the validation as follows:

```ts
groupedTranslation("validation", {
  required: {
    en: ":input is required",
    ar: "مطلوب :input",
  },
});
```
