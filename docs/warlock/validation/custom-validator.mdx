# Custom Validator

Consider a custom validator as the final middleware interceptor before processing the request, it's used to validate the request after the validation rules.

## How it works

After running all validation rules, `Warlock` will try to identify the request handler `validate` method, if exists, it will run it, and pass the request and response objects to it.

The `validate` method acts as a [middleware](./../http/middleware), it receives the request and response objects, if it returns a response object, then the request will be terminated, and the response will be sent back to the client, otherwise, the request will be processed normally.

## Example

Let's take an example of the `login` request:

```ts title="src/app/users/routes.ts"
import { router } from "@mongez/warlock";
import { login } from "./controllers/auth/login";

router.post("/login", login);
```

The `login` function is the request handler, and it's located at `src/app/users/controllers/auth/login.ts`:

```ts {9} title="src/app/users/controllers/auth/login.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@mongez/warlock";
import { User } from "app/users/models/user";

export default async function login(request: Request, response: Response) {
  // do logic here
}

login.validation = {
  validate: async (request: Request, response: Response) => {
    // custom validation here
    const user = await User.attempt(request.only(["email", "password"]));

    if (!user) {
      return response.unauthorized();
    }

    // inject the user object to the request object
    // Make sure to not return a value, otherwise the request will be terminated
    request.user = user;
  },
};
```
