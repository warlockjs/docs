# Pattern

Check if the input value matches a given pattern.

The validation rule **requires a value** to run.

The pattern rule can not be used as a string, it must be declared as a rule class:

## Example

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/create-account.ts"
// ...
import { PatternRule } from "@warlock.js/core";

const usernamePattern = /^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$/;

createAccount.validation = {
  rules: {
    username: ["required", new PatternRule(usernamePattern)],
  },
};
```

## Pass the translation key

If the validation failed, the error message will be something like this:

```ts
username must match the following pattern: [[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}].
```

To override the pattern, pass the second argument as the translation key:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/create-account.ts"
// ...
import { PatternRule } from "@warlock.js/core";

const usernamePattern = /^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$/;

createAccount.validation = {
  rules: {
    username: ["required", new PatternRule(usernamePattern, "usernamePattern")],
  },
};
```

Now you should translate the `usernamePattern` in any of your localization files.
