# Exists

Check if the input value exists in the database.

> This rule is a database dependent rule. It requires a database connection to run against the input value.

> The validation rule **requires a value** to run against the input value.

For the time being, this rule does not support custom string rule, so the rule class must be called directly.

## Example

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/login.ts"
// ...
import { ExistsRule } from "@mongez/warlock";
import { User } from "../models/user";

login.validation = {
  rules: {
    email: ["required", "email", new ExistsRule(User, "email").insensitive()],
  },
};
```

## Extends Unique

Please note that the exists rule extends [Unique Rule](./unique) so any method available in the unique rule is also available in the exists rule.
