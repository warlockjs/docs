# Request

**Warlock Request** is the incoming request object, it contains all the information about the request, and it is used to get the request body, query string, headers, and more.

## Request params

Request params are the dynamic segments in the request path, for example in the following route:

```ts title="src/app/users/routes.ts"
import { router } from "@warlock.js/core";

router.get("/users/:id", getUser);
```

In this example, when the user requests `/users/1`, the `id` param will be `1`.

Let's see how to access it:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-user.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function getUser(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const user = await User.find(request.params.id);
  response.success({
    user,
  });
}
```

## Request query string

Query string is the part of the URL after the `?` character, for example in the following URL:

```
https://example.com/users?name=John&age=20
```

The query string is `name=John&age=20`.

Let's see how to access it:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const users = await User.find({
    name: request.query.name,
    age: request.query.name,
  });

  response.success({
    users,
  });
}
```

If the query params has a `[]` as a key suffix, then it will be treated as an array, for example:

`sitename.com/products?brands[]=1&brands[]=2&brands[]=3` will be parsed as:

```ts
//...
const brands = request.query.brands; // [1, 2, 3]
```

## Request body

Request body are the payload data that is being sent in `POST` `PUT` `PATCH` requests, for example in the following request:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/create-user.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function createUser(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const user = await User.create({
    name: request.body.name,
    age: request.body.age,
  });

  response.success({
    user,
  });
}
```

As mentioned in the request query, if the request body input has a `[]` as a key suffix, then it will be treated as an array, for example:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/create-user.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function createUser(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const user = await User.create({
    name: request.body.name,
    age: request.body.age,
    brands: request.body.brands, // [1, 2, 3]
  });

  response.success({
    user,
  });
}
```

## Json and Form Data Requests

By default, `Warlock` parses both types out of the box, so you don't need to add additional work, it will parse the request body and make it available in `request.body` property.

# Request Input

This is the recommended way to access any type of data from request wether it is from `params` `query` or `body`.

To access any value from the request, use the `input()` method:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/create-user.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function createUser(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const user = await User.create({
    name: request.input("name"),
    age: request.input("age"),
  });

  response.success({
    user,
  });
}
```

:::info
The `input()` method accepts a default value as a second argument if the input is missing.
:::

:::tip
Using `input()` method is the recommended way to access request payload regardless of the request method.
:::

### Dot Notation Support

When sending a json request, you can use the dot notation to access nested values, for example in the following request:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 20
  }
}
```

To get the `name` value, use the following:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/create-user.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function createUser(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const name = request.input("user.name");

  response.success({
    name,
  });
}
```

## Int Values

As you already know, any value from the request is a string, but sometimes we need to get an integer value, for example in the following request:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const users = await User.find({
    age: request.int("age"),
  });

  response.success({
    users,
  });
}
```

This will convert the `age` value to an integer, if the input is missing or not an integer, it will return `0`.

> You can of course pass the second argument to the `int()` method to set a default value.

## Float Values

Similar to the `int()` method, the `float()` method converts the input value to a float number, if the input is missing or not a float number, it will return `0`.

## Number Values

This method is a combination of `int()` and `float()` methods, it converts the input value to a number, if the input is missing or not a number, it will return `0`.

## Boolean Values

When using `request.bool()` method, If the request input is present, then all values will be marked as **true** except for `false` value.

::info
When using `bool` method, if the input's value is `false` as a string, it will be converted to `false` as boolean value.
:::

## Check if request has a value

To check if the request has a value in any payload type, use the `has()` method:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const hasAge = request.has("age");

  response.success({
    hasAge,
  });
}
```

## Set value to request payload

Sometimes we need to update the request payload with additional data, this usually happens in `middleware`, to do so, use `request.set` method

```ts title="src/app/users/middleware/auth.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function auth(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const authorizationHeader = request.header("Authorization");

  if (!authorizationHeader) {
    return response.unauthorized();
  }

  const user = await User.find(request.input("id"));

  request.set("email", user.get("email"));
}
```

## Unset values from request

To unset multiple values from the request, use the `unset()` method:

```ts title="src/app/users/middleware/auth.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function auth(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const authorizationHeader = request.header("Authorization");

  if (!authorizationHeader) {
    return response.unauthorized();
  }

  request.unset(["id", "name"]);
}
```

## Get entire request payload

To get the entire request payload, use the `all()` method:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/create-user.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function createUser(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const user = await User.create(request.all());

  response.success({
    user,
  });
}
```

> Please note that this method will return the entire request payload, including the `params` `query` and `body` but not including request files.

In some situations, you don't want to get the request params, you need only the request query and body, in this case use `allExceptParams` method.

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/create-user.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function createUser(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const user = await User.create(request.allExceptParams());

  response.success({
    user,
  });
}
```

## Get certain values from request

To get certain values from the request payload, use `only` method, it accepts an array of keys that you want to get from the request payload and returns an object.

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/create-user.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function createUser(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const user = await User.create(request.only(["name", "age"])); // { name: "John", age: 20 }

  response.success({
    user,
  });
}
```

## Get all values except certain values

To get all values from the request payload except certain values, use `except` method, it accepts an array of keys that you want to exclude from the request payload and returns an object.

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/create-user.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function createUser(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const user = await User.create(
    request.except(["id", "createdAt", "updatedAt"])
  ); // { name: "John", age: 20 }

  response.success({
    user,
  });
}
```

## Get heavy inputs

Sometimes, a request payload may contain inputs but with empty strings, consider the following request url

`example.com/users/1?name=&age=20`

If we use `request.all()` method, it will return the following object:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "",
  "age": 20
}
```

To get the heavy inputs, use `request.heavy()` method, it will return the following object:

This will return the following data

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "age": 20
}
```

This will return all data from `params` `query` and `body`.

To get all heavy data except the params data, use `request.heavyExceptParams()` method, it will return the following object:

```json
{
  "age": 20
}
```

## Request files

When send a `multipart/form-data` request, you can access the files using the `file` method:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/create-user.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export async function createUser(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const image = request.file("image");
}
```

The `file` method may return a `UploadedFile` instance, or `null` if the file is missing.

If the request contains multiple files with the same name, then the `file` method will return an array of `UploadedFile` instances.

For more details about uploaded files, check it in the [Uploaded Files Section](./uploaded-files).

## Validation

Sometimes you want to [validate](./../validation/introduction) some inputs on a middleware, or in `validation.validate` method, in this case, you can use `request.validate` method, which accepts an object of rules or a [Validation Schema](./../validation/validation-schema):

```ts
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export default async function login(request: Request, response: Response) {
  //
}

login.validation = {
  validate: async (request: Request, response: Response) => {
    const user = await User.findBy("email", request.input("email"));

    if (!user) {
      return response.badRequest({
        email: "Email is not found",
      });
    }

    if (user.get("isAdmin")) {
      const validator = await request.validate({
        superPassword: ["required", "minLength:8"],
      });

      // if validation fails, then return the validation by passing the validator to the response
      if (validator.fails()) {
        return response.validationFailed(validator);
      }
    }
  },
};
```

This case we have to first fetch the user from the database then perform validation, if the user is not found, then we return a bad request response, if the user is found, then we check if the user is an admin, if the user is an admin, then we validate the `superPassword` input, if the validation fails, then we return a validation failed response.

## Get validated inputs only

To get only the validated inputs that are listed in `validation.rules` object, use `request.validated()` method:

```ts
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

export default async function login(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const { email, password } = request.validated(); // will return only the email and password
}

login.validation = {
  rules: {
    email: ["required", "email"],
    password: ["required"],
  },
};
```

If an input is listed in the `rules` object but not required and missing, then it will not be returned, for example if we added `gender: in:male,female` in this case, the gender input is optional, if not present in the request payload, it will be ignored.

## Request headers

Request headers are the HTTP headers sent with the request, for example the `Accept` header, `Content-Type` header, and more.

To get a single header, use the `header()` method:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const acceptHeader = request.header("Accept");

  response.success({
    acceptHeader,
  });
}
```

It may accept a default value for second argument if the header is missing:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const acceptHeader = request.header("Accept", "application/json");

  response.success({
    acceptHeader,
  });
}
```

To get all headers, use the `headers` property:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const headers = request.headers;

  response.success({
    headers,
  });
}
```

## Request Authorization value

If the `Authorization` header is present in the request, you can get its value using the `authorization` property:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const authorization = request.authorization;

  response.success({
    authorization,
  });
}
```

It will return the value of the `Authorization` header, if the header is not present, it will return `null`.

### Authorization Value

To get the authorization value use `authorizationValue` property instead, for example if the request Authorization header is:

`Authorization: key apiKey`

Then the `authorizationValue` will be `apiKey`.

If it contains a `Bearer Token` then the token will be returned directly without the `Bearer` prefix.

## Request path

Get current request path using the `path` property:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const path = request.path;

  response.success({
    path,
  });
}
```

## Request url

Get current request url using the `url` property:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const url = request.url;

  response.success({
    url,
  });
}
```

### Get full url

To get the full url (not including the query string) use `fullUrl` property instead:

```ts {7} title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const fullUrl = request.fullUrl;

  response.success({
    fullUrl, // https://example.com/users
  });
}
```

## Request Ip

To get the request IP, use the `ip` property:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const ip = request.ip;

  response.success({
    ip,
  });
}
```

This will work as it will return the current ip address, however, if the app is running under a proxy, it will return the proxy ip address, to get the real ip address, use the `realIp` property:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const ip = request.realIp;

  response.success({
    ip,
  });
}
```

This works by trying to get the ip from the `x-real-ip`, if the header is not found, then a `x-forwarded-for` header is used, if the header is not found, then the default ip will be returned.

## User Agent

To get the user agent, use the `userAgent` property:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const userAgent = request.userAgent;

  response.success({
    userAgent,
  });
}
```

## Request Referer

To get the request referer, use the `referer` property:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const referer = request.referer;

  response.success({
    referer,
  });
}
```

## Request Method

To get the request method, use the `method` property:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getUsers(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const method = request.method;

  response.success({
    method,
  });
}
```

## Request hostname

Request `hostname` property returns the hostname of the request, for example in the following request:

```
https://example.com/users
```

The hostname is `example.com`.

> `request.domain` is an alias for `request.hostname`.

If the application is running under a proxy, then use `originalDomain` instead.

## Request Protocol

Request `protocol` property returns the protocol of the request, for example in the following request:

```
https://example.com/users
```

```ts
console.log(request.protocol); // https
```

## Request Locale Code

When dealing with a multilingual apps, its important to know the current locale code, to get the current locale code, use the `locale` property:

```ts title="src/app/users/controllers/get-users.ts"
import { Request, Response } from "@warlock.js/core";

export async function getLocale(request: Request, response: Response) {
  const locale = request.locale;

  response.success({
    locale,
  });
}
```

The locale property will try to find one of the following headers in the incoming request to fetch the locale code from

- `translation-locale-code`
- `locale-code`
- `locale`

If none of the headers is found, then it will return the default locale code from [Application default Locale Code Configuration](./../getting-started/configurations#localeCode).
