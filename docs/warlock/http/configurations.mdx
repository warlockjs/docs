# Http configurations

Http configurations are used to set the default http configurations, like the port, host, and other configurations.

## Defining http configurations

Let's go to our `src/config/http.ts` file and define the http configurations.

```ts title="src/config/http.ts"
import { env } from "@mongez/dotenv";
import { HttpConfigurations } from "@warlock.js/core";

const httpConfigurations: HttpConfigurations = {
  port: env("PORT", 3000),
  host: env("HOST", "localhost"),
  log: true,
  fileUploadLimit: 12 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024,
  rateLimit: {
    max: 260,
    duration: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  },
  cors: {
    // allowed origins
    origin: "*", // change it to the list of allowed origins or a string
    // allowed methods
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH", "OPTIONS"],
  },
  middleware: {
    // apply the middleware to all routes
    all: [],
    // apply the middleware to specific routes
    only: {
      // Example:
      // routes: [],
      // namedRoutes: ["users.list"],
      // middleware: [authMiddleware("user")],
      routes: [],
      namedRoutes: [],
      middleware: [],
    },
    // exclude the middleware from specific routes
    except: {
      routes: [],
      namedRoutes: [],
      middleware: [],
    },
  },
};

export default httpConfigurations;
```

Let's break down the above code:

- `port`: The port that the application will run on, default to `3000`.
- `host`: The host that the application will run on, default to `localhost`.
- `log`: Enable or disable the http logs, default to `true`.
- `fileUploadLimit`: The file upload limit, if not defined in env then set it to `12 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024` (12 MB), default is `10 MB`.
- `rateLimit`: The rate limit configurations, it's used to limit the number of requests per minute, default to `60` requests per minute but we applied it to `260` requests per minute.
- `middleware`: The middleware configurations, it's used to apply the middleware to all routes, or to specific routes, or to exclude the middleware from specific routes.

### Http port

If port is being used in development mode, then `Warlock` will try to find another port to run the application on.

### Rate Limit

Rate limit is used to limit the number of requests per minute, it's useful to prevent the application from being attacked by sending a lot of requests in a short time.

The default value is `60` requests per minute, but if the application has a lot of requests, then you can increase the value as applied above.

## Cors

Cors stands for `Cross-Origin Resource Sharing`, it's a mechanism that allows a web application running at one origin to access the resources from a server running at a different origin.

### Why Cors?

Cors is used to make sure that the application can access the resources from a different origin, for example, if you have a frontend application running on `https://example.com` and you have an API running on `https://api.example.com` then you need to enable Cors to make sure that the frontend application can access the API.

### Cors configurations

By default, `Warlock` allows all origins, but you can change this behavior by setting the value of `cors` to the list of allowed origins.

### Cors Origin

As mentioned above the `origin` is used to set the list of allowed origins.

If `origin` is set to `*` it will accept all origins, but if you want to set a list of allowed origins you can set it to an array of strings.

```ts title="src/config/http.ts"
const corsConfigurations = {
  // allowed origins
  origin: ["https://example.com", "https://api.example.com"],
  // allowed methods
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH", "OPTIONS"],
};
```

Or you can just pass a string to it.

```ts title="src/config/http.ts"
const corsConfigurations = {
  // allowed origins
  origin: "https://example.com",
  // allowed methods
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH", "OPTIONS"],
};
```

### Cors Methods

Probably you don't need to change this, but if you want to change the allowed methods you can change it by setting the value of `methods` to the list of allowed methods.

```ts title="src/config/http.ts"
const corsConfigurations = {
  // allowed origins
  origin: "*",
  // allowed methods
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH", "OPTIONS"],
};
```

:::warning
Be aware that browsers use the `OPTIONS` method to check if the API is allowed to be accessed from the frontend application, so make sure to add it to the list of allowed methods.
