# Request Context

Request context is a special function in `Warlock` that allows you to access the request and response objects from anywhere in your application.

## How it works

Any incoming request is wrapped inside a context, a context is a container for the request middle and handler executers that will be executed in order.

In that sense, we can access the request and response objects from anywhere in our application.

## Accessing the request context

To get the request context object, use `requestContext()` method.

```ts title="src/app/users/events/update-author.ts"
import { requestContext } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { User } from "./../models/user";

User.events().on("saving", (user) => {
  const { request } = requestContext();

  if (!request) return;

  const user = request.user;

  user.set("updatedBy", user.id);
});
```

:::info
Whenever you use the request context, you must always check if there is a request object or not, because the request context is not available in the background jobs or inside any other process that is not a request.
:::

## RequestContext contents

The request context returns three objects if available:

- `request`: The request object.
- `response`: The response object.
- `user`: the logged in user, but this is only available if the user is logged in either as a guest or any type of user.
