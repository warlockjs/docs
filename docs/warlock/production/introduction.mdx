# Production

Production is the final step in the application development, it's the step where we deploy the application to the production server.

## Build the application

After finishing the development, we need to build the application, to do that, run the following command:

```bash
warlock build
```

This will compile the application and generate the `dist` directory with `app.js` file.

This file could be used to run the application from anywhere.

## Build Configuration

The project is created with a `warlock.config.ts` file, this file contains the build configurations and any other configurations that is not related to the application but to Warlock itself.

## Warlock Configurations

To override the default configurations, update the `warlock.config.ts` file.

```ts title="warlock.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@mongez/warlock";

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    outFile: "app.js",
  },
});
```

The following options are available under the `build` property:

- `outFile`: specifies the output file name, the default value is `app.js`.
- `outDirectory`: specifies the output directory, the default value is `dist`.
- `bundle`: Whether to bundle the dependencies or not, the default value is `false`.

## Bundling the dependencies

When the build is done, it will import all the dependencies from the `node_modules` directory, this will reduce the file size significantly.

But if you want to have the entire application bundled in one file, then you should enable the `bundle` property and set it to **true**.

So an application without bundling would be around `100-200KB` based on the application size, but with bundling, it could go up to `5-6MB`.
