# Introduction

Uploading is a common task in web applications, it's used to upload images, videos, documents, and other types of files.

## How it works

When creating a new `Warlock` project, it is shipped with `uploads` module to lift up the uploading process hassle from you.

## Uploads Module

Let's head to `src/app/uploads/routes.ts` and see what's inside:

```ts title="src/app/uploads/routes.ts"
import {
  deleteFile,
  getUploadedFile,
  getUploadedFileUsingHash,
  router,
  uploadChunkedFiles,
  uploadFiles,
} from "@mongez/warlock";
import { adminPath, guarded } from "app/utils/router";

guarded(() => {
  // Upload files
  router.post(["/uploads", adminPath("/uploads")], uploadFiles);
  // Upload chunked files
  router.post(
    ["/uploads/chunks", adminPath("/uploads/chunks")],
    uploadChunkedFiles
  );
  // Delete file by hash from the database
  router.delete(["/uploads/:hash", adminPath("/uploads/:hash")], deleteFile);
});

// Get uploaded file using the file path directly
router.get("/uploads/*", getUploadedFile);
// Get uploaded file using hash
router.get("/uploads/:hash", getUploadedFileUsingHash);
```

Let's break it down into pieces:

## Uploading Files

Warlock has two ways to upload files, either uploading a one or more files, or uploading a chunked file.

## Deleting Files

As a result of the uploading files, each uploaded file will return an object contains the [Upload Output](./upload-model#upload-output) which contains the file hash.

This hash is used to delete the file from the database, and the file itself from the storage.

## Getting Uploaded Files

There are two ways to get the uploaded file, either using the file path directly, or using the file hash.
