# Compressing images

Another powerful feature is compressing images after being uploaded and before stored, this will significantly reduce the size of the images and save the storage space.

To enable compression, set the `compress` property to `true`.

```ts title="src/config/uploads.ts"
import { UploadsConfigurations, requestContext } from "@warlock.js/core";

const uploadsConfigurations: UploadsConfigurations = {
  /**
   * Compress the uploaded images
   */
  compress: true,
};

export default uploadsConfigurations;
```

:::info
All images regardless its type will be compressed and stored as `webp` format.
:::

By enabling images compression, the original file will be deleted and replaced with the compressed one.

:::tip
It's recommended to enable compression in production environment to reduce the storage space and enhance performance.
