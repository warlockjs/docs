# Uploads configurations

Uploads are essential for any application, this section will cover the uploads configurations to give you a better control over how files are being uploaded and transformed.

## Save To Directory

All files are stored inside `storage directory` under the `uploads` directory `storage/uploads` for security reasons, for now you can set the default relative path to this path.

The default path for any uploaded file is `DD-MM-YYYY/{Hash}` directory, but you can change this behavior by setting the `saveTo` property to a function that returns the path to save the file to.

```ts title="src/config/uploads.ts"
import { UploadsConfigurations, requestContext } from "@warlock.js/core";

const uploadsConfigurations: UploadsConfigurations = {
  /**
   * The default path to save the uploaded files
   */
  saveTo: () => {
    return "files";
  },
};

export default uploadsConfigurations;
```

## Compressing images

Compressing images will convert any image type into `webp`, this will reduce the image size significantly and save the storage space, a better performance will be achieved as well.

For more information about compressing images, please refer to [Compressing images](./compressing-images).
