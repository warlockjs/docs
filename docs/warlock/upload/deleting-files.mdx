# Deleting Files

To delete uploaded file, use `/uploads/:hash` endpoint with `DELETE` method.

The `:hash` is the file hash returned from the [Upload model](./upload-model).

## Deleting Files from the Database

To delete the file from the database, use the `deleteFile` function from `@warlock.js/core`:

```ts {10} title="src/app/uploads/routes.ts"
import { router, deleteFile } from "@warlock.js/core";
import { adminPath, guarded } from "app/utils/router";

guarded(() => {
  router.post(["/uploads", adminPath("/uploads")], uploadFiles);
  router.post(
    ["/uploads/chunks", adminPath("/uploads/chunks")],
    uploadChunkedFiles
  );
  router.delete(["/uploads/:hash", adminPath("/uploads/:hash")], deleteFile);
});
```

:::note
Please note that we used an array of route to allow deleting files apis from either the admin or the front office side.
:::

:::danger
If the files should be deleted from the admin side only, then add the `adminPath` function only.
