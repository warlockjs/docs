# Memory Cache Driver

The memory cache driver stores data in memory, it will be persisted until the application is restarted.

## Driver name

The default name for the driver is `memory`.

## Options

The memory cache driver has the following options:

- `globalPrefix`: A prefix that will be added to all keys. This is useful when you want to use the same cache driver for multiple applications, it could be a `string` or a callback that returns a `string`, if not provided then there will no be prefix for the keys.
- `ttl`: Time to live in seconds, the default value is `Infinity`.

## Usage

To use the memory cache driver, you need to define it in the drivers list in the cache configurations file:

```ts title="src/config/cache.ts"
import { env } from "@mongez/dotenv";
import {
  CacheConfigurations,
  MemoryCacheDriver,
  requestContext,
} from "@warlock.js/core";

const cacheConfigurations: CacheConfigurations = {
  drivers: {
    memory: MemoryCacheDriver,
  },
  default: env("CACHE_DRIVER", "memory"),
  options: {
    memory: {
      globalPrefix: "online-store",
      ttl: 60 * 60 * 24, // 24 hours
    },
  },
};

export default cacheConfigurations;
```

This will allow the cache manager to pick it if there is no `CACHE_DRIVER` environment variable defined.

We set the global prefix to `online-store`, this will be added to all keys. This is useful when you want to use the same cache driver for multiple applications, it could be a `string` or a callback that returns a `string`, if not provided then there will no be prefix for the keys.

All cache keys will remain for 24 hours, after that they will be removed.

:::note
Please note that the Memory Cache Drier implements all methods in [Cache Driver Interface](./cache-driver-interface) so you can use it directly as a cache driver.
