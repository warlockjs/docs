# Cache Manager

This is the core of the entire cache ecosystem. It is responsible for managing the cache drivers, and the cache configurations.

You can access the cache manager by importing `cache` from warlock.

## Setting Configurations

After you define [Cache Configurations](./configurations), you can set them using the `setConfigurations` method.

```ts title="src/config/cache.ts"
import { CacheConfigurations } from "@warlock.js/core";
const cacheConfigurations: CacheConfigurations = {
  //...
};

export default cacheConfigurations;
```

The configuration will be automatically loaded when the cache manager is initialized.

## Initializing the cache manager

By default `Warlock` initializes the cache manager to start connecting to the default driver when the `http server` is about to start so you don't really need to take any action in this regard.

## Cache Manager is a Cache Driver

All methods that are available on [Cache Driver](./cache-driver-interface) are available on the cache manager so you will be able to use the cache manager as a cache driver.

## Get current driver

If you want to directly access the current cache driver from the cache manager, use `currentDriver` property.

```ts
import { cache } from "@warlock.js/core";

const currentDriver = cache.currentDriver;
```

:::info
If there is no current driver, then the cache manager will use the [NullCacheDriver](./null) instead.
:::

## Set default driver

To change the default driver, use `use` method, this method accepts the driver name Defined in [ Cache drivers list](./configurations#drivers) or pass the driver object directly.

```ts
import { cache } from "@warlock.js/core";

cache.use("redis");
```

:::info
Please note that `use` method is a `async` method, as if the driver was not loaded before, the cache manager will load it first before using it so make sure to use `await` keyword when calling this method.
:::

## Get driver

To get another cache driver (but not set it as a default driver) use `driver` method, it accepts the driver name.

```ts title="src/main.ts"
import { cache } from "@warlock.js/core";

async function main() {
  const redisDriver = await cache.driver("redis");

  const memoryDriver = await cache.driver("memory");
}

main();
```

:::info
If the driver is not loaded before, the cache manager will load it first before returning it.
:::

:::danger
If the given driver name is listed in [ Cache drivers list](./configurations#drivers), it will throw an error.
:::

## Global prefix

Global prefix option is implemented in all built-in drivers, it highly recommended to use it as a way to avoid key conflicts especially if you're using a common cache driver like redis.

:::info
Consider a global prefix as a database name in a database server, it is used to separate the keys from each other.
:::

## Setting a value in the cache

To set a value in the cache, use `set` method, this method accepts three parameters:

- The first one is the key that will be used to store the value in the cache.
- The second one is the value that will be stored in the cache.
- The third one is the number of seconds that the value will be stored in the cache.

```ts
import { cache } from "@warlock.js/core";

// somewhere in the project
await cache.set("key", "value", 60 * 60 * 24);
```

The value can be any type of value either a string, number, boolean, or even an object or an array.

```ts
import { cache } from "@warlock.js/core";

// somewhere in the project
await cache.set("key", { name: "John Doe" }, 60 * 60 * 24);
```

The key could be a `string` or an object, if it is an object, it will be converted to a string using [Parse Cache Key utility](./utils#parse-cache-key).

```ts
import { cache } from "@warlock.js/core";

// somewhere in the project
await cache.set({ id: 1 }, { name: "John Doe" }, 60 * 60 * 24);
```

This will result a key like this : `id.1`.

:::tip
If the global prefix is set, then it will be prefixed with the global prefix.
:::

If the third parameter is not set `ttl` then the driver will try to capture it from the driver options, if not found then the value will be stored in the cache forever.

## Getting a value from the cache

To get a value from the cache, use `get` method, this method accepts one parameter which is the key that will be used to get the value from the cache.

```ts
import { cache } from "@warlock.js/core";

// somewhere in the project
const value = await cache.get("key");
```

It can also accept an object as a key, it will be converted to a string using [Parse Cache Key utility](./utils#parse-cache-key).

```ts
import { cache } from "@warlock.js/core";

// somewhere in the project
const value = await cache.get({ id: 1 }); // this will be converted to id.1
```

If the key does not exists a `null` value will be returned.

## Removing a value from the cache

To remove a value from the cache, use `remove` method, this method accepts one parameter which is the key that will be used to remove the value from the cache.

```ts
import { cache } from "@warlock.js/core";

// somewhere in the project
await cache.remove("key");
```

It can also accept an object as a key, it will be converted to a string using [Parse Cache Key utility](./utils#parse-cache-key).

```ts
import { cache } from "@warlock.js/core";

// somewhere in the project
await cache.remove({ id: 1 }); // this will be converted to id.1
```

## Removing all values from the cache

To clear the entire cache, use `flush` method.

```ts
import { cache } from "@warlock.js/core";

// somewhere in the project
await cache.flush();
```

## Namespaces

Another good approach that is powered by `Warlock Cache` is namespaces, it allows you easily to categorize all the cached data by a namespace.

A namespace is a string that is suffixed with a `dot` then the key, for example, if we have a namespace called `users`, then the key `1` will be converted to `users.1`.

### Removing all values from a namespace

To clear the entire cache for a namespace, use `removeNamespace` method, this method accepts one parameter which is the namespace that will be used to remove the values from the cache.

```ts
import { cache } from "@warlock.js/core";

// store a value in the cache
await cache.set("users.1", {
  id: 1,
  name: "John Doe",
});

await cache.set("users.list", [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "John Doe",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Jane Doe",
  },
]);

// somewhere in the project
await cache.removeNamespace("users");
```

This will clear out all the values that are stored under the `users` namespace.
