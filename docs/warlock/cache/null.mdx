# Null Cache Driver

The null cache driver is a cache driver that does not cache anything. It is useful for testing and debugging purposes.

It does not store, retrieve, or delete anything. It is a cache driver that does nothing.

## Options

This driver does not have any options.

## Driver name

The default name for the driver is `null`.

## Usage

You can use it for testing purposes or when you want to disable the cache.

```ts title="src/config/cache.ts"
import { cache, NullCacheDriver } from "@warlock.js/core";

cache.setConfigurations({
  default: "null",
  drivers: {
    null: {
      driver: NullCacheDriver,
    },
  },
});
```

:::note
Please note that the Null Cache Drier implements all methods in [Cache Driver Interface](./cache-driver-interface) so you can use it directly as a cache driver.
